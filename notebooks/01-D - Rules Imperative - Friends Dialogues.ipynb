      "RACHEL What?\n",
      "ROSS What?\n",
      "RACHEL You think about stuff like that?\n",
      "ROSS Uhh, yeah. I mean, actually I kinda think that we'll have, we'll have two babies.\n",
      "RACHEL Two, two babies?\n",
      "ROSS Yeah. Ya know, a boy and a girl. Hopefully the girl will come first so Ben here won't feel too competitive.\n",
      "RACHEL Then what's gonna happen?\n",
      "ROSS Well, we won't wanna raise kids in the city so we'll probably move to uh, Scarsdale.\n",
      "RACHEL Uh-huh.\n",
      "ROSS Yeah, that way I figure, ya know, we'll be far enough away from our parents that we don't have to see them all the time but close enough that they can come over and babysit whenever we want. And yes, I know, the taxes are a little higher than, let's say, Nassau county but the school system's supposedly great.\n",
      "RACHEL Wow. Wow, that's great. Great. Ok, wow, you know what.\n",
      "ROSS Huh?\n",
      "RACHEL I'm off my break now so uh, um here you take this [hands back Ben] and um, I am gonna go pour these very nice people some coffee. Ok. Oh look at that, I don't have a pot. I don't have a pot. Well, hey, maybe I've got one at home, or in Scarsdale. Hey is that a door? [leaves]\n",
      "PHOEBE Hey.\n",
      "RICHARD Hey Phoebs, what's happening?\n",
      "PHOEBE Oh, ok, murder, cancer, soccer teams eating each other in the Andes.\n",
      "MONICA So you watched the movies huh?\n",
      "PHOEBE Uh huh, what is happening to the world? I mean, no no no, 'cause ET leaves, and and Rocky loses, Charlotte dies.\n",
      "RICHARD Charlotte who?\n",
      "PHOEBE With the web, the spider she dies, she does. She has babies and dies. It's like ya know, hey welcome home from the hospital, thud.\n",
      "MONICA Alright, you wanna feel better?\n",
      "PHOEBE Yeah.\n",
      "MONICA Ok, here, watch this.\n",
      "PHOEBE It's a Wonderful Life. Yes I've heard of this.\n",
      "MONICA So you can't lose, it's there in the title. Wonderfullness is baked right in.\n",
      "PHOEBE Please, I almost fell for that with, uh, Pride of the Yankees, I thought I was gonna see a film about Yankee pride and then, boom, the guy gets Lou Gehrig's disease.\n",
      "RICHARD Uh, the guy was Lou Gehrig. Didn't you kinda see it coming?\n",
      "PHOEBE Phoebe, just watch that, I promise it will resotre all your faith in humanity.\n",
      "CHANDLER [runs in] Hey, big guy, game time.\n",
      "RICHARD Hey, be right there.\n",
      "MONICA There's a game?\n",
      "CHANDLER Uh, yeah, I just got my pick-up sticks back from the shop. Bring your nerves of steel.\n",
      "RICHARD It's the basketball playoffs.\n",
      "MONICA Listen, um honey, I appreciate this but you don't have to keep hanging out with them for me, I mean, they have each other.\n",
      "RICHARD Oh, no, honey, I mean, don't worry, I like hanging out with those guys. It's fun for me. They're different than my other friends, they don't start sentences with, 'You know who just died shoveling snow?'\n",
      "MONICA Alright that's great, then just go. Go Knicks.\n",
      "RICHARD Uh, it's the college playoffs.\n",
      "MONICA Oh, then go Vassar.\n",
      "RICHARD Uh, they're not in it.\n",
      "MONICA Ok, then just go.\n",
      "RICHARD Ok. [leaves]\n",
      "MONICA Oh, why does this bother me so much? I mean I don't wanna be one of those people who tells their boyfriend they wanna spend 24 hours a day with them.\n",
      "PHOEBE Sure.\n",
      "MONICA It's just that he doesn't have that much free time, ya know, and I don't know, what do I do?\n",
      "PHOEBE Does it matter? You're ultimately just gonna die or get divorced or have to blow your pets head off.\n",
      "RACHEL [enters] Aghh.\n",
      "PHOEBE Me too. [leaves]\n",
      "MONICA I've got a question. Richard made plans again with the guys.\n",
      "RACHEL Yeah well, Ross just made plans for the whole century.\n",
      "MONICA Ya know what, I think I'm gonna go to my room and read Cosmo, maybe there's something helpful in there. Know what, at least maybe I can learn how to do an at home bikini wax with leftover Cristmas candles.\n",
      "ROSS [enters] Ok, what the hell happened back there?\n",
      "RACHEL I don't know, you tell me. One minute I'm holding Ben like a football, the next thing I know, I've got two kids, I'm living in Scarsdale complaining about the taxes.\n",
      "ROSS Well I'm sorry, I think about stuff. Ya know, I mean, you're at work, you're assembling bones, your mind wanders.\n",
      "RACHEL Ross, you have planned out the next 20 years of our lives, we've been dating for six weeks.\n",
      "ROSS C'mon, what, you never think about our future?\n",
      "RACHEL Yes, but I, I think about who's apartment we're gonna sleep at tomorrow night and, and where we're gonna have dinner next Saturday night. I do not think about what our childrens' names are gonna be. You know what our childrens names are gonna be.\n",
      "ROSS No, no, I mean, ya know, I, I read a book and there was a girl named Emily and I thought, I thought that might be good.\n",
      "RACHEL What was the book?\n",
      "ROSS The big book of childrens' names.\n",
      "RACHEL Ok, Ross, Ross, ok listen, what we have is amazing.\n",
      "ROSS Yeah.\n",
      "RACHEL But I do not want to have everything decided for me. I spent my whole life like that. It's what I had with Barry, that was one of the reasons I left. I, I like not knowing right now and I'm sorry if that scares you but if you want to be with me you are gonna have to deal with that.\n",
      "ROSS Ok fine.\n",
      "RACHEL Thank you.\n",
      "ROSS We're not done.\n",
      "RACHEL I didn't know that.\n",
      "ROSS Ok, then you're gonna have to understand that you're with a guy who's not gonna stop planning his future with you because he knows that we're gonna end up together and if that scares you, tough, 'cause you're gonna have to deal with that.\n",
      "RACHEL Fine, I will.\n",
      "ROSS Good, 'cause I love you.\n",
      "RACHEL Oh yeah.\n",
      "ROSS Yeah.\n",
      "RACHEL Well I love you too.\n",

      "RACHEL Yes it is.\n",
      "ROSS Well, I'm gonna kiss you.\n",
      "RACHEL Well you better.\n",
      "PHOEBE Hey. Oh thanks for the great movie tip.\n",
      "MONICA Did you like it?\n",
      "PHOEBE Oh yeah. You know, I don't know if I was happier when um George Bailey destroyed the family business or um, Donna Reid cried, or when the mean pharmacist made his ear bleed.\n",
      "MONICA Alright, I'll give you the ear thing but don't you think the ending was pretty wonderful?\n",
      "PHOEBE I didn't watch the ending, I was too depressed. It just kept getting worse and worse, it should have been called, \"It's a sucky life and just when you think it can't suck any more it does.\"\n",
      "CHANDLER Kick save and... denied.\n",
      "RICHARD But... he gets it back, pass to the middle, lines it up and... BAM! Yes! Could that shot BE any prettier?\n",
      "JOEY Man you are incredible.\n",
      "RICHARD Well, we had a table in college.\n",

      "Joey Come on man! You never want to do anything since you and Janice broke up.\n",
      "Chandler That’s not true! I wanted to wear my bathrobe and eat peanut clusters all day. I wanted to start drinking in the morning. Don’t say that I don’t have goals!\n",
      "Joey Chandler, you have to start getting over her. All right, if you play, you get some fresh air, maybe it’ll take your mind off Janice, and if you don’t play, everyone will be mad at you ‘cause the teams won’t be even. Come on.\n",

      "Monica Anyway, Ross and I were always captains, and um, it got kind’ve competitive and one year, Geller Bowl VI, I accidentally broke Ross’s nose.\n",
      "Ross It was soo not an accident. She saw I was about to tag her, so she threw her big fat grandma arm elbow right into my face. And just keep running.\n",
      "Monica To score the winning touchdown, by the way.\n",
      "Ross Whoa, whoa, whoa, ho, ho, ho, you did not win the game, the touchdown didn’t count, because of the spectacularly illegal, oh and by the way savage nose breaking.\n",
      "Monica (to Chandler and Joey) I won the game.\n",
      "Ross Oh yeah! Then how come you didn’t get the Geller Cup?\n",
      "Rachel Um, there was a Geller Cup?\n",
      "Ross Yes, it was the trophy you got if you won the game. But our Dad said, ‘nobody won that game, ‘ and he was sick of our fighting, so he took the trophy and.... (pauses to collect himself, as he is on the verge of tears saying this) threw it in the lake.\n",
      "Chandler And was the curse lifted?\n",
      "Ross Anyway. That’s when our Mom said we were not to play football ever again.\n",

      "Chandler And then Tineals.\n",
      "Phoebe Okay, so how do we decide that?\n",
      "Monica Well, why don’t we just bunny up.\n",
      "Rachel, Chandler, and Joey What?\n",
      "Monica and Ross (holding both of their hands above their heads making rabbit ears with their fingers.) Bunny!\n",

      "Joey Thanks man, but I think it makes a stronger statement if I ask for it myself, y'know.\n",
      "Chandler Whoa-ho, whoa! No, I was thinking about y'know for me, as a part of that whole getting over Janice thing you were talking about.\n",
      "Joey Oh, yeah, that. All right, means that much to ya, I’ll let you have her.\n",
      "Chandler Thanks. What, let me have her?! What do mean? Like if you didn’t I wouldn’t have a shot?\n",

      "Joey It’s hard, y'know, his huddle is closer to Dutch girl.\n",
      "Monica All right look, if I take Chandler out of the running will you be able to focus?\n",
      "Joey What are you gonna do?\n",
      "Monica All right, you just make sure that Chandler catches the ball, I’ll take care of the rest.\n",

      "Ross Whoa! Whoa! Whoa! What’s with the tackling?\n",
      "Monica What?! I just touched him and he went over.\n",
      "Ross Okay, you wanna play rough, we can play rough.\n",

      "Ross Hey, where’d you get that?\n",
      "Rachel I went really long.\n",
      "Monica Forty-two to twenty-one! Like the turkey, Ross is done!\n",
      "Ross It’s no surprise that your winning, ‘cause you got to pick first, so you got the better team.\n",
      "Monica You’re so pathetic! Why can’t you just accept it, we’re winning because I’m better than you.\n",
      "Monica Oh, what a great argument, exhaling! All right, y'know what, I’ll prove it to you, okay. I’ll trade you Joey for Rachel, and I’ll still win the game.\n",
      "Ross What?! The guys against the girls? See, that’s ridiculous Monica, because I’m only down by three touchdowns.\n",
      "Monica Oh, then bring it on! Oh, unless of course your afraid you might lose to a bunch of girls.\n",
      "Ross Fine, fine, Rachel your with Monica, Joey you’re with me.\n",
      "Rachel I can not believe your trading me!!\n",
      "Monica Come on Rach, come on. Let’s see what’s it like to be on a winning team for a change.\n",
      "Rachel Are you gonna let me play?\n",
      "Monica All right then.\n",
      "Margha (coming over) The game is over, we eat now?\n",
      "Chandler No-no-no-no, the game’s not over, we’re just switching teams.\n",
      "Joey Yeah, Chandler finds me so intimdating that it’s better if we’re on the same team.\n",
      "Ross Right. Okay, let’s play. Let’s go.\n",
      "Chandler No ah, hold on a second Joe, where do Dutch people come from?\n",
      "Joey Ah well, the ah, Pennsylvania Dutch, come from Pennsylvania.\n",
      "Chandler And the other ah, Dutch people, they come on from somewhere near the Netherlands, right?\n",
      "Joey Nice try. (to Margha) See the Netherlands is this make believe place where Peter Pan and Tinker Bell come from.\n",

      "Ross Enough with geography for the insane, okay? Let’s play some ball, guys.\n",
      "Joey Whoa, whoa, no, no, I-I’m not playing with this guy, now.\n",
      "Chandler Fine with me.\n",
      "Ross Okay, y'know what, let’s just cut to the chase here. Okay? Heidi, which of my boys do you like?\n",
      "Chandler and Joey What are you doing? What are you doing? What are you doing?\n",
      "Margha Which do I like?\n",
      "Ross Yeah, y'know for dating, general merriment, taking back to your windmill...\n",
      "Margha Well, if I had to chose right now, which by the way I find really weird, I would have to say, Chandler.\n",
      "Chandler Yes!!\n",
      "Joey Wait a minute! Wait a minute! She obviously didn’t understand the question.\n",
      "Chandler Well, you don’t you have Captain Hook explain it to her.\n",
      "Margha I’m sorry, Joey, that is my chose.\n",
      "Chandler You hear that! That is her chose, mister I’ll let you have her! I win! You suck! I rule all! A mini-wave in celebration of me!! (does the wave.)\n",
      "Margha I’m now thinking I would like to change my answer to, no one.\n",
      "Chandler Wh-what?\n",
      "Margha I now find you shallow and um, a dork. All right, bye.\n",

Look, is there something wrong with me? I mean why am I only attracted to guys where there’s no future? Either they’re too old, or they’re too young, and then there’s Pete who’s-who’s crazy about me, and who’s absolutely perfect for me, and there’s like zip going on!

      "Chandler Stop what?!\n",
      "Ross I don’t know, but I ah, I have the feeling that my being there will do it. I’ll go over and I will borrow something. Juice!! I need juice!!\n",
      "Chandler No!! You can’t!!\n",
      "Ross Look, they must be stopped!\n",
      "Chandler I am your friend, and I am not gonna let you do this!! (Ross is now dragging Chandler and the foosball table to the door) You are surprisingly strong!\n",

      "Chandler She’s moving on! Okay, if it’s not this guy, it’s gonna be somebody else! And unless you’re thinking about subletting my peep hole, you are going to have to get used to the fact that the relationship is over! Okay, man? It’s over.\n",
      "Ross Yeah, okay.\n",
      "Chandler Okay.\n",

      "Mark Why do all you’re coffee mugs have numbers on the bottom?\n",
      "Rachel Oh. That’s so Monica can keep track. That way if one on them is missing, she can be like, ‘Where’s number 27?!’\n",
      "Rachel Y'know what?\n",
      "Mark No. And I don’t think I’m gonna want to.\n",
      "Rachel I can’t do this.\n",
      "Mark Yep. Yep, that’s what I didn’t want to know.\n",
      "Rachel Well, oh, Mark, I’m doing this for the wrong reasons, y'know? I’m just doing it to get back at Ross. I’m sorry, it’s not very fair to you.\n",
      "Mark Ahh! Fair, schmair! Y'know? Look, if you want to get back at Ross, I am here for you. Really? No-no, I say-I say, I say we get back at him right on this couch. Right here!\n",

      "Monica So I did tell you. Okay, y'know, that really isn’t the thing. Umm, the thing is that, right now I’m just in a place in my life where I need to focus on me. Y'know what I mean?\n",

      "Pete Yeah, stupidly charming isn’t’ it? Well listen let’s, you wanna get something to eat? ‘Cause this place is kinda depressing. (they start to leave)\n",

      "Chandler I think somebody has a crush on somebody.\n",
      "Joey Hey, Chandler, can we please stay focused on my problem here?! Y'know?\n",
      "Chandler I’m talking about you. You big, big freak.\n",
      "Joey Oh. (realises) Ohh. Ohh, you’re out of your mind.\n",
      "Chandler Hey, you have nothing but talk about her for the last 48 hours! If you were in a school yard you’d be pulling her pigtails and pushing her down now!\n",

      "Kate Happy?! Is that what I’m supposed to be Vic? Happy?\n",
      "Joey Well, why don’t you tell me what you’re supposed to be! Huh? Because I sure as hell can’t figure it out! I talk to you and it’s nothin’. You look at me, and nothin’. (He kisses her, more passionately this time) Nothing.\n",

      "Monica By the way, Ross dropped by a box of your stuff.\n",
      "Rachel Oh, well, I guess I had that one coming. I’m just gonna throw it out, it’s probably just a bunch of shampoo and... (she opens the box and stops)\n",
      "Monica Something wrong?\n",
      "Rachel (She takes the T-shirt out of the box and holds it to her chest and take a deep breath.) No. Nothing. (She smiles and goes into her room.)\n",
      "Chandler So, ahh, what kind of powers would Gold Man have?\n",
      "Phoebe Okay well, he would turn things to gold.\n",
      "Chandler What about things that are already gold?\n",
      "Phoebe Ahh, his work is done.\n",
      "Chandler Okay, let’s play my game now.\n",
      "Phoebe Okay. All right you yellow-bellied-lilly-livered-DRAW!! (they both kick up the foot rests like an old fashioned gun fight.)\n",

      "Rachel Hi Joey, how ya doin’?\n",
      "Joey Great! Roomie!\n",
      "Rachel Huh, yeah I guess we are roommates now.\n",

      "Rachel I’m not paying for half of that! I’m only staying here until my apartment gets fixed.\n",
      "Joey Look Rach, my parents bought this fridge just after I was born, okay? Now, I have never had a problem with it. Then you show up and it breaks! What does that tell ya’?\n",
      "Rachel That refrigerators don’t live as long as people.\n",
      "Joey All right, now you know that the ATM will only lets you take out 300 at a time, I’ll take a check for the other hundred.\n",

      "Joey Oh, I’m sorry. Thank you Chandler.\n",
      "Rachel Anyway, there’s this big charity ball this weekend and Ralph Lauren bought a table, so I kinda have to go…\n",
      "Monica What’s the charity?\n",
      "Rachel I don’t know, something either trees or disease—Ralph mumbles a lot.\n",
      "Monica Does Ralph mumble when you’re not paying attention?\n",
      "Rachel Yeah! It’s weird. But the thing is need to find a date.\n",
      "Phoebe Well, what kind of guy are you looking for?\n",
      "Rachel Well, someone that has his own tux, or has the ability to rent a tux.\n",
      "Chandler So he has to be a male who has at least $50.\n",
      "Joey Ooh! So close.\n",

      "Elizabeth Oh, we’re not together.\n",
      "Ross Oh no-no-no, we’re just two people who happen to run into each other here at the coffee house. (He winks at her.)\n",
      "Phoebe Oh, sly.\n",

      "Elizabeth Oops! I did not mean to run into you like that sir.\n",
      "Ross Oh that is quite all right ma’am. (Elizabeth exits.)\n",
      "Chandler So, why is she leaving? Is it a school night and she has a lot of homework to do?\n",
      "Ross Yes, her molecular epidemiology paper is due tomorrow.\n",

      "Monica Oh, I like Elizabeth.\n",
      "Ross Well thanks!\n",
      "Monica Yeah. In fact, I like her so much you tell her I want my cookies early this year! Y’know, a box of Thin Mints and some Tag-a-Longs.\n",
      "Joey Hey-hey come on you guys, give him a break. Ross, seriously, how’s it going with her?\n",
      "Ross Well, actually it’s been great. She’s 20 so she’s not looking for anything too serious, which is perfect for me right now.\n",
      "Monica Well that is great. And seriously, she seems very nice.\n",
      "Ross Thanks. I know you guys like to give me a hard time and all, but it really means a lot to me that you like her. Just knowing that you guys are…\n",
      "Phoebe (interrupting) Okay, I got a good one. Okay, umm, what is she? Like 12?\n",
      "Monica Chandler, do you think we talk about our relationship enough?\n",
      "Chandler Yeah. Do we have any Fruit Roll-Ups?\n",
      "Phoebe (entering) Hey!\n",
      "Monica Hey!\n",
      "Phoebe Okay, I just thought of the perfect guy for Rachel to take to her thing.\n",
      "Chandler Oh that’s so funny because we found someone too.\n",
      "Phoebe Oh that’s good, I guess she’ll have a choice between my guy and your weirdo.\n",
      "Chandler Why would our guy be a weirdo?\n",
      "Phoebe ‘Cause that’s just your taste.\n",
      "Monica (laughs sarcastically) Rachel is not going to pick your stupid guy.\n",
      "Phoebe Oh yeah?\n",
      "Monica Yeah!\n",
      "Phoebe My guy is a lawyer who has volunteer work. And, he has one of these (She squeezes the skin on her chin together to form…)\n",
      "Chandler A face ass?\n",
      "Phoebe A chin dimple!\n",
      "Monica Well, uh y’know, our guy works with Chandler and he’s really nice and smart and he’s a great dresser!\n",
      "Phoebe Have you seen your guy’s body?\n",
      "Chandler No, our guy is just a floating head.\n",
      "Phoebe Well my guy is spectacular. Okay? He’s a massage client and one time umm, when he was on the table, I looked at it. And I mean all of it.\n",
      "Monica You’re not supposed to look!\n",
      "Phoebe Oh yeah, like there are police for that!\n",
      "Chandler (horrified) Wait! You look? You-you massaged me.\n",
      "Phoebe I know. (Laughs.)\n",
      "Monica All right fine, your guy may have a great body, but our guy is really funny.\n",
      "Phoebe Oh, Chandler funny?\n",
      "Monica Our guy’s a great dancer!\n",
      "Phoebe My guy is well read.\n",

      "Chandler Our guy smells incredible.\n",
      "Monica (To Chandler) Do you want our guy to be your guy?\n",
      "Chandler Hey.\n",
      "Joey Huh.\n",
      "Chandler Well, you…don’t look good Joe.\n",
      "Joey The fridge broke. I have to eat everything. Cold cuts, ice cream, limes—Hey, what was in that brown jar?\n",
      "Chandler That’s still in there?!\n",
      "Joey Not anymore. So anyway, how do you want to pay me?\n",
      "Chandler Is this a service you’re providing me?\n",
      "Joey No! No! No! For my new fridge—our new fridge!\n",
      "Chandler Our new fridge? I don’t live here anymore.\n",
      "Joey So what? Look, suppose we were a divorced couple.\n",
      "Chandler Uh-huh.\n",
      "Joey And I got custody of the kid, right? Now suppose the kid dies and-and I gotta buy a new kid.\n",
      "Chandler (not quite sure where Joey’s going and is a little worried) Okay…\n",
      "Joey (pause) Give me $400!\n",
      "Elizabeth Professor Geller?\n",
      "Ross Hmm? (Turns around and sees that its Elizabeth) Oh, a student I don’t know.\n",
      "Elizabeth I was wondering if I could talk to you for a moment?\n",
      "Ross Yes, yes of course, what-what would this be regarding?\n",
      "Elizabeth Making out in your office.\n",
      "Ross Shh! (Laughs then composes himself) Of course, why don’t we go inside?\n",
      "Ross Oh-ooh!\n",
      "Elizabeth What?\n",
      "Ross Doorknob! Doorknob!\n",
      "Elizabeth Oh! Sorry! Umm, I actually do need to talk to you.\n",
      "Ross Oh, okay. What-what about?\n",
      "Elizabeth Spring vacation.\n",
      "Ross Spring vacation.\n",
      "Elizabeth Yeah, we have time off and a lot of people are going on trips…\n",
      "Professor Feesen Professor Geller!\n",
      "Ross (quickly jumping away from Elizabeth) Yes, professor Feesen-sen-stenlger… I’ll be with you in one moment. (To Elizabeth) So, I will take one box of the Thin Mints. (And he ushers Elizabeth out of the office.)\n",
      "Ross You don’t understand! Elizabeth was about to ask me to go on a trip with her! Is that taking it slow?! No, I’m not ready for this! Okay? What-what do I tell her?\n",
      "Chandler Just tell her the truth! Tell her you’re not ready.\n",
      "Ross I can do that. Oh-oh, what if she gets upset?\n",
      "Chandler Then you distract her with a Barbie doll.\n",
      "Joey Or! You can just, y’know… (He walks up close to whisper in Ross’s ear and when he gets there he pushes Ross into the fridge.)\n",
      "Ross What the hell are you doing?\n",
      "Joey What? What the hell am I doing? You just broke my fridge!\n",
      "Ross What?! What? How do you, how do you even know its broken?!\n",
      "Joey Oh-ho-ho, you think I don’t know what breaks my fridge? Excuse me! (He opens the door and feels inside.) Well what do you know! Broken! That’ll be $400!\n",
      "Chandler Joey, I saw you push him!\n",
      "Joey (pause) You pushed him!\n",
      "Ross Joey, I did not break this! Okay? (He opens the freezer and smells inside and recoils in disgust.) That has been broken for a while.\n",
      "Joey All right. Chandler, do you remember how I told you about our fridge?\n",
      "Chandler Uh-huh.\n",
      "Joey I still haven’t gotten a check for your half yet.\n",
      "Ross Do not give him any money!\n",
      "Joey I’m not talking to you! You broke my fridge!\n",
      "Elizabeth You wanted to see me Professor Geller?\n",
      "Ross Yes. Yes! Please, come in.\n",
      "Ross Oo-oo!\n",
      "Elizabeth Doorknob?\n",
      "Ross Yeah, it kinda grows on you. (They both laugh.) Actually, I wanted to finish talking to you about uh, spring vacation.\n",
      "Elizabeth Oh good.\n",
      "Ross Look, I… (He has trouble sitting in his chair.) Look, I’m having a great time with you and I just don’t want us to move to fast or put to much pressure on us. So, I’m sorry I just don’t think we should go away together yet. It’s-it’s too soon.\n",
      "Elizabeth Ross, I think you misunderstood what I was saying. I just wanted to tell you that I’m going to Florida for a couple weeks.\n",
      "Ross No. I think you misunderstood what I was saying. What I meant was…\n",
      "Elizabeth You are so adorable.\n",
      "Ross That! Let’s talk about that.\n",
      "Ross Hey!\n",
      "Chandler Hey!\n",
      "Phoebe Hey!\n",
      "Monica Hey! How did it go with Elizabeth?\n",
      "Ross Huh? Oh-oh, it was fine. Uh, it was just a misunderstanding. She didn’t want me to go with her. She just wanted to let me know that she’s going to Florida for spring vacation.\n",
      "Chandler Wait a minute, is she going for spring vacation or is she going for spring break? (Does a little whooping/party noise.)\n",
      "Ross What’s-what’s the difference?\n",
      "Monica Well, spring vacation is doing nice things with your grandparents. Spring break you’re doing frat guys.\n",
      "Ross Hey, y’know what? Not all spring breaks are like that.\n",
      "Phoebe What did you do on yours?\n",
      "Ross I went to Egypt with my dad.\n",
      "Chandler I can see it now, \"Look dad, it’s the Sphinx!\" (Does that party noise again.)\n",
      "Ross Hey, I think Elizabeth is a little more serious than, \"Spring break!\" (Imitates the party noise.) All right? I mean she’s taken my class!\n",
      "Monica And slept with the professor.\n",
      "Ross I’m gonna call her.\n",
      "Chandler Yeah.\n",
      "Rachel Hey! You guys umm, I want you to meet Sebastian.\n",
      "Sebastian Hi.\n",
      "Rachel We just uh, we just met at the newsstand. We both grabbed for the last Field & Stream. (Chandler’s shocked.) What? I read that.\n",
      "Sebastian Can I get you a cup of coffee?\n",
      "Rachel Oh yes! Thank you! (He does so and Rachel sits down on the couch.)\n",
      "Phoebe Rachel, what the hell is this?!\n",
      "Rachel (shocked) What?\n",
      "Phoebe You ask us to find you a guy and you come traipsing in here with your own!\n",
      "Rachel You found me a guy?\n",
      "Monica Yes! We found you a really cute and funny guy from Chandler’s work!\n",
      "Phoebe Yeah and I-I found you one too who is not a weirdo.\n",
      "Rachel Well, y’know what though you guys? I really appreciate that but I think I’m just gonna take Sebastian to the charity.\n",
      "Chandler Are you sure?! Because our guy smells incredible!\n",
      "Monica Uh, would you stop it with that already?!\n",
      "Sebastian Here you go. (Hands her, her cup.)\n",
      "Rachel Oh, thank you.\n",
      "Sebastian Sure.\n",
      "Phoebe So, Sebastian, do you do any volunteer work?\n",
      "Sebastian Uh, no not really. Why?\n",
      "Phoebe No reason, it’s just I know a single guy that cares about other people.\n",
      "Chandler Are you funny?\n",
      "Sebastian Excuse me?\n",
      "Rachel What are you guys doing?\n",
      "Monica Are you funny? Tell us a joke!\n",
      "Sebastian Look, I just wanted to have coffee with Rachel.\n",
      "Phoebe Well, so do a lot of people.\n",
      "Sebastian Actually, I uh, I gotta get going. (To Rachel) Give me a call sometime.\n",
      "Rachel Oh, but y’know, no, you didn’t give me your phone number.\n",
      "Sebastian Okay! See you later! (Exits.)\n",
      "Chandler (To Monica) Turns out he is kinda funny.\n",
      "Rachel I cannot believe you guys! He was really nice and he left because of you!\n",
      "Chandler Yeah, but Sebastian? What is that? A cat’s name?\n",
      "Phoebe Yeah, y’know what I noticed Rachel? He scares easy. Is that the kind of guy you’d like to take to a ball? \"Hey Sebastian, would you like to dance?\" (Imitates him.) \"Uhh, okay—I gotta go!\"\n",
      "Monica All right guys stop it. Rachel, we’re very sorry that is a very insensitive thing for us to do. And y’know what? Let us make it up to you, we have two really great guys for you.\n",
      "Phoebe Yeah! What have you got to lose? Y’know you might even end up with someone really special (whispers) if you pick my guy.\n",
      "Rachel All right.\n",
      "Chandler Okay, so you will meet our guys?\n",
      "Rachel Yes, I’ll meet ‘em.\n",
      "Chandler Okay now it doesn’t matter which one you choose, y’know? It’s completely up to you. Our guy is perfect, or you can go out with the guy Phoebe deemed not good enough to go out with herself.\n",
      "Joey (entering) Pheebs! There you are! Okay, you broke my fridge; you owe me 400 bucks!\n",
      "Phoebe Okay sure!\n",
      "Joey Really?!\n",
      "Phoebe Ooh, technically you owe me $600 for sending out happy thoughts on your last ten auditions.\n",
      "Joey Call it even?\n",
      "Phoebe Okay.\n",
      "Chandler (To Ross) Well, there you are! So what did Elizabeth say?\n",
      "Ross Well, it turns out that she is going to Daytona for spring break woo-hoo. That means, that means wet T-shirt contests, guys doing shots off of girl’s bodies, waking up next to people you don’t even know…\n",
      "Joey Man, she is going to have a great time! Is she staying at the Hotel Corona?\n",
      "Chandler You know the hotels?\n",
      "Joey Sure! I was there! Spring Break ’81! Woo-hoo!\n",
      "Monica In 1981 you were 13!\n",
      "Joey So what? I drove down, sold T-shirts, had a blast. And y’know who knows how to party? Drunk college chicks.\n",
      "Ross Okay, she can’t go.\n",
      "Phoebe Ross, you can’t tell her not to go. You just started dating.\n",
      "Ross Then what am I supposed to do?\n",
      "Phoebe Nothing, you just have to be cool with it.\n",
      "Ross Well, what is she goes down and-and sleeps with a bunch of guys?\n",
      "Chandler Well, maybe you don’t marry this one.\n",
      "Ross I’m so glad you’re going on this trip!\n",
      "Elizabeth Yeah! I’ve been working so hard this semester. I really need to go crazy y’know, blow off some steam.\n",
      "Ross Sure. Sure. Look I don’t, I don’t know if your plans are finalized yet, but umm, hey I-I know another great way to blow off steam.\n",
      "Elizabeth What?\n",
      "Ross Are you into crafts at all?\n",
      "Elizabeth Ross, are you okay?\n",
      "Ross Well, yeah, of-of course I’m okay! What? I’m just being supportive. Supportive of you and this whole trip, and-and (notices something) what-what is uh, what’s this? (He holds up a rather skimpy bathing suit.)\n",
      "Elizabeth It’s a bathing suit?\n",
      "Ross To wear in front of people?\n",
      "Elizabeth Is that supportive?\n",
      "Ross Is this?!\n",
      "Monica Hey!\n",
      "Chandler Good-good-good-good.\n",
      "Monica Hey!\n",
      "Chandler Hey!\n",
      "Rachel Hi!\n",
      "Monica We’re really glad you decided to meet our guy.\n",
      "Rachel Oh…\n",
      "Monica You’re gonna like him so much. So umm, when do you want to meet him?\n",
      "Rachel I don’t know. I know I don’t work late tomorrow night.\n",
      "Chandler Tomorrow night is good. Tomorrow night is good, but uh, y’know what? Why put off something till tomorrow that you can do right now? (Laughs) Eldad come here! (He stands up from the next table.)\n",
      "Rachel What?\n",
      "Monica Eldad, this is Rachel.\n",
      "Eldad How are you?\n",
      "Rachel Well-well a little blind sided but y’know good.\n",
      "Chandler Eldad, sit down. (To Rachel) Move over! Move over now!\n",
      "Rachel I—Ohh! (Moves over and lets Eldad sit on the couch.)\n",
      "Chandler There you go! There you are! (Rachel stares at Monica and Chandler)\n",
      "Monica Okay! Okay! We can take a hint! (They start to leave but run into Phoebe with her guy in tow.) (To Phoebe) What are you doing here?!\n",
      "Phoebe This is Patrick. (Points to him.)\n",
      "Patrick Hi.\n",
      "Chandler Hi. (To Phoebe) Okay, you’re too late okay? Because she’s already with our guy.\n",
      "Phoebe (looks) Oh my God, you’re right! I am too late; they’re sitting on the couch and talking! (To Patrick) Come on! (They go over to the couch.) Rachel?\n",
      "Rachel Yeah?\n",
      "Phoebe This is Patrick.\n",
      "Rachel Oh, hi.\n",
      "Patrick Hi.\n",
      "Phoebe Yeah, this is the guy I was telling you about.\n",
      "Rachel Yeah?\n",
      "Phoebe Yeah. And believe me, this suit does not do justice to what’s underneath it.\n",
      "Rachel Oh-okay, but Pheebs?\n",
      "Phoebe Yeah?\n",
      "Rachel I’m just sort of in the middle of something.\n",
      "Phoebe Oh! Okay! Yeah, that’s okay. (To Patrick) Have a seat. (Sits Patrick down next to Rachel.)\n",
      "Monica No! You can’t do that!\n",
      "Eldad Maybe I should go!\n",
      "Monica (stopping him) Sit down! We’re winning!\n",
      "Rachel Okay, y’know what? Maybe I should go!\n",
      "All (Chandler stops her) No-no-no-no! Have a seat! Have a seat!\n",
      "Monica Rachel! Rachel! You haven’t touched Eldad’s hair!\n",
      "Chandler It is the softest hair! Touch it! (Both he and Monica do so.)\n",
      "Rachel Yeah, I’m good.\n",
      "Phoebe Rachel? Patrick is really rich. (To Patrick) Give her some money.\n",
      "Patrick Y’know what Phoebe? This isn’t really worth the free massage.\n",
      "Monica That’s right Patrick, bye-bye!\n",
      "Chandler (To Rachel) Eldad is much more cooperative! And he can dance! (To Eldad) You dance for Rachel!\n",
      "Rachel No-no! Don’t dance for me! Please? Don’t! (She gets up to yell at her ‘friends.’) What is the matter with you guys?\n",
      "Phoebe Yeah, okay, let’s talk it out.\n",
      "Rachel I… Am I the only one that this is embarrassing for?\n",
      "Eldad I’m a little embarrassed. (Chandler shushes him.)\n",
      "Rachel I’ll tell ya who should be embarrassed! It’s you guys! Come on! This is ridiculous! Thank you very much, but I do not need you to get me a date!\n",
      "Phoebe Then why did she ask us to…\n",
      "Rachel I am still talking!! And then you chase away the one guy that I actually liked! I mean, no offense to you guys. Really! I mean (To Patrick) congratulations on all the cash, (He nods) and-and y’know—(Feels Eldad’s hair)—Wow! You do have very soft hair! But I would much rather go to the ball all by myself than go through anymore of this! Good-bye! (Grabs her stuff, starts to leave, then turns back suddenly, and to Eldad) Now do you use some sort of special conditioner on that hair?!\n",
      "Eldad Yes, Papaya Extract.\n",
      "Rachel Thank you! (Storms out.)\n",
      "Ross So uh, have a great time down there.\n",
      "Elizabeth I will.\n",
      "Ross Yeah. And did you, did you pack that bathing suit?\n",
      "Elizabeth Yeah.\n",
      "Ross It was pretty funny when I, when I hid it for a while, huh? Anyway, umm, I-I am worried about that bathing suit, not because it’s revealing which I’m fine with, no I’m concerned about your health, sun exposure.\n",
      "Elizabeth Oh, don’t worry I have plenty of sun block, it’s SPF-30.\n",
      "Ross Well, if what’s in the bottle is actually 30. I mean sometimes you get 30, sometimes it’s-it’s get 4, and I swear to God more often than not it’s just milk.\n",
      "Elizabeth Ross, it’s going to be okay. I’m not going down there to hook up with a bunch of guys. I really like you. I like how things are going between us.\n",
      "Ross Really?\n",
      "Elizabeth Yeah! I’m just going down there to relax and hang out with my friends.\n",
      "Ross Okay. Cool.\n",

      "Phoebe That’s not Ralph Lauren. Sounds like him though.\n",
      "Rachel What?\n",
      "Phoebe Yeah, no, Ralph doesn’t look anything like that guy. He’s-he’s young and he’s got long hair and a beard and a hacky sack.\n",
      "Rachel Oh My God, Phoebe, that’s not Ralph Lauren. That’s Kenny the copy guy.\n",
      "Phoebe What?\n",
      "Rachel Oh..Go..Oh..and I told my boss that someone made out with Ralph Lauren. If she finds out that I lied to her, she is going to hate me even more. Phoebe!!\n",
      "Phoebe Why would the copy guy say he was Ralph Lauren?\n",
      "Rachel To get you to make out with him!!!\n",
      "Phoebe Ohhh.\n",
      "Monica (Holding a shirt in front of Ross.) Okay, maybe this will make your teeth look less white. (Ross has a big smile.) Nope. Okay, colors that don’t work are blue, yellow, green, red, black, white, orange, and purple.\n",
      "Ross I don’t know what I’m going to do. That date starts in like an hour.\n",
      "Monica Hey Ross, maybe if your skin was lighter. Your teeth wouldn’t look so bright.\n",
      "Ross Oh great. So all I need to do is get some new skin. Thank you.\n",

      "Ross No. I am not putting on makeup. (Knock at the door. Phoebe enters.)\n",
      "Phoebe Hello. Oh good. Ross could you put up some of these flyers for me? (He smiles at her.) OH!! Demon!! Demon!!\n",
      "Monica Now are drawers will smell nice and we didn’t waste these pantyhose.\n",
      "Chandler Yes, God forbid we throw out old underwear. You-you know what? I’m going to go over to Joey’s.\n",
      "Monica Wait, we’re supposed to organize the wrapping paper drawer.\n",
      "Chandler Yes, but I feel like I’ve really gotten in touch with my feminine side enough today. You know. In fact I think we’re two sachets away from becoming a lesbian couple.\n",
      "Monica You know what? This has been kind of a girlie day. You’re right, I’m sorry.\n",
      "Chandler Nah, Nah, it’s okay. I feel like I need to be in guy place. You know, do kind of like a man thing.\n",
      "Monica Yeah. Go over to Joey’s. Go over to Joey’s and drink some beer and hammer up some drywall.\n",
      "Chandler You know when guys hang out they don’t just drink some beer and hammer up drywall?\n",
      "Monica When girls hang out, we don’t have pillow fights in our underwear. (Chandler gets a hurt look on his face.) I’m sorry. We do. We do. I don’t know why I said that.\n",
      "Joey Hey Chandler. Come on in. We’re knitting pot holders.\n",
      "Chandler No thanks, Josephine.\n",
      "Chandler Hey Ross, I was wondering if… Oh my God!! Where are all the men???\n",
      "Rachel Ohh, hi, Kim.\n",
      "Kim Hi Rachel.\n",
      "Rachel Yeah, remember that thing I told you that happened yesterday? Well it didn’t happen.\n",
      "Kim You didn’t cancel the fabric order from Taiwan?\n",
      "Rachel Okay, two things didn’t happen. Remember I told you that someone made out with Ralph Lauren in the copy room? Well, it turns out that’s not true.\n",
      "Kim That’s not true?\n",
      "Rachel No.\n",
      "Kim Oh that’s interesting? Because I checked and only one keycard was used to access the copy machine yesterday during lunch and that keycard belonged to you, Rachel.\n",
      "Rachel Oh no, no, no. Oh God, you think I made out with him.\n",
      "Kim Listen to me. If you think sleeping with Ralph is going to get you my job. You are sadly mistaken.\n",
      "Rachel I-I don’t want your job. I-I don’t. Ohh this is such a mistake. I did not make out with him. Nobody made out with him. I did not use my keycard yesterday. I don’t even know how to use my keycard. (The elevator stops. Ralph steps on.)\n",
      "Kim Hi Ralph.\n",
      "Ralph Lauren : Hi Kim. (Dead silence until Ralph gets off the elevator.)\n",
      "Kim Yeah, nothing happen. You could cut the sexual tension in here with a knife.\n",
      "Hillary And after that, what could I do except become a chef.\n",
      "Ross Mmm-Hmm.\n",
      "Hillary And someday soon, I hope to open my own restaurant.\n",
      "Ross Mmm.\n",
      "Hillary You know, you’re a really great listener. Most guys I go out with, they just talk and talk.\n",
      "Ross Mm-Hmm.\n",
      "Hillary After a while it’s like, shut your mouth, you know?\n",
      "Ross (Chuckling) Hmm-Hmm.\n",
      "Hillary I’ve probably been talking too much. Why don’t we talk about you a little bit?\n",
      "Ross Mmm-Unmm.\n",
      "Hillary Come on. I want to know.\n",
      "Ross Hmm-Hmm-Hmm. (Putting his hand up to block his mouth.) Okay. I, uh, am from Long Island. I-I came to the city for college. Um, I, um, have a 5 year old son and in my spare time I like to read spy novels. But, but, let’s talk more about you. Hmm.\n",
      "Joey So what’s really neat. If you sear the stems of the flowers first in a frying pan, your arrangement will look fresh much longer.\n",
      "Monica Oh my God, Joey, that is such a great tip.\n",
      "Chandler Monica, could you excuse us for a second? I need to talk to the girl with the flowers.\n",
      "Monica Okay. Oh but Joey, come over later because I’m going to teach you to make a bird feeder out of just a pine cone and some peanut butter.\n",
      "Joey Ohh, I love birds. (Monica leaves. Chandler shuts the door.)\n",
      "Chandler What is the matter with you ?!?\n",
      "Joey What?\n",
      "Chandler You’re arranging flowers! (Pointing to the dish on the table.) You got dead flowers! You got a picture, a picture, of a baby dressed like flowers! This is not Joey!!\n",
      "Joey Hey. Hey look I am still Joey, okay. Flowers they’re just, you know, they’re nice to look at. And that happens to be a picture by a famous artist. Of a famous baby.\n",
      "Chandler You’re turning into a women.\n",
      "Joey No I’m not. Why would you say that? That’s just mean.\n",
      "Chandler Now I’ve upset you? What did I say?\n",
      "Joey It’s not what you said. It’s the way you said it….Oh My God, I’m a women!!!\n",
      "Rachel Now, she thinks that I made out with him and I did it to get her job.\n",
      "Phoebe But why didn’t you just tell her the truth.\n",
      "Rachel I did but she doesn’t think anyone would be stupid enough to confuse Kenny the copy guy with Ralph Lauren.\n",
      "Phoebe Well, hey, what if Kenny were the real brains behind the whole company? You know. What if Kenny hired that Ralph Lauren guy to be the pretty front man? Huh, did she ever think of that?\n",
      "Rachel You were with Kenny today, weren’t you?\n",
      "Phoebe Just for a second.\n",
      "Rachel Ohh, Phoebe, what am I going to do?\n",
      "Phoebe Well, the only thing you can do. Sleep with Ralph Lauren.\n",
      "Rachel I’m not going to sleep with Ralph Lauren. I mean, I could, but I wouldn’t.\n",
      "Phoebe Ohh, sleep with Kenny.\n",
      "Rachel That wouldn’t help me.\n",
      "Phoebe Ohh, yes it would.\n",
      "Hillary I’ve had a really good time tonight.\n",
      "Ross Mmm.\n",
      "Hillary You know, I rarely connect with someone this much on the first date.\n",
      "Ross (Giggling) Hmm-Hmm-Hmm. (Picking up a piece of bread and covering his mouth.) Me, neither. I’ve had a really good time too, you know. (Putting the bread down.)\n",
      "Hillary Are you going to eat that bread?\n",
      "Ross (Putting the bread up to his nose.) Ohh, I just like the smell. (Sniffing it.) Mmmm.\n",
      "Hillary (Laughing) You make me laugh.\n",
      "Ross Hmm-Hmm.\n",
      "Hillary Would you like to move over to the couch?\n",
      "Ross Mmm-Hmm. (Picking up their wine glasses.)\n",
      "Hillary Maybe I’ll just turn the lights down a little.\n",
      "Ross (Covering his mouth with the glass.) How about all the way.\n",
      "Hillary Okay. (She goes to turn the lights off and Ross sits on the couch. She has some black light posters on the wall.)\n",
      "Ross (Looking at the posters.) Wow, cool poster. Or should I say groovy poster? (They sit down on the couch. Ross smiles and the black light fluoresces his teeth.) So, ahh, where were we?\n",
      "Hillary Are those your teeth??\n",
      "Ross Ohh, you can see them, huh?\n",
      "Hillary Yes. They’re insanely white.\n",
      "Ross I-I, did that for you.\n",
      "Hillary What’s a matter with you?\n",
      "Ross What’s a matter with me? You’ve got a black light. It’s 1999!\n",
      "Rachel Kim, hi.\n",
      "Kim Hi Rachel. Ohh, I’ve been meaning to ask you. Have you seen the new Ralph Lauren sheets? Ohh, what am I thinking. Of course you have.\n",
      "Rachel Okay..Okay.. Look. I’m sorry that I lied to you before. You were right. Ralph and I were an item but were not anymore.\n",
      "Kim Oh, really?\n",
      "Rachel (Faking crying.) Yeah, he dumped me. He said, \"Rachel, I can’t do this. Even though you are a very, very, very beautiful women. I can’t do this. I’m married and I’m sorry.\" And then I don’t know why but he said, \"and you will never get promoted. Especially not above Kim, who is an integral cog in the Ralph Lauren machine.\"\n",
      "Kim You expect me to believe..(Doors open, Ralph steps in.) Hi Ralph.\n",
      "Ralph Lauren : Hi Kim. (Dead silence again until he gets off.)\n",
      "Kim Oh my God. He just gave you the coldest look I have ever seen. It’s like he hates you. Then it is true.\n",
      "Rachel Of course it’s true and it hurts so bad.\n",
      "Kim Ohh honey come here. (Hugging Rachel.) Ohh it will be ok. We’ve all been there.\n",
      "Rachel You and Ralph?\n",
      "Kim Kenny the copyboy.\n",
      "Janine Hey.\n",
      "Joey Hey, uhh, I need to talk to you.\n",
      "Janine What’s the matter? Are you upset?\n",
      "Joey I’m sorry but we’ve got to get rid of all this girlie stuff in here. I, uh, I got to be a man! Okay. The living room has to remain a guy place, okay? That’s just the way it has to be.\n",
      "Janine Well, if that’s what you want. I’ll just put it all in my room.\n",
      "Joey Great…Great…and thanks for being so understanding. I mean, I didn’t want to make a big deal out of this, you know. (She starts to collect all the girlie stuff up.) You could, uh, put the picture of the famous baby in my room. I mean, if you want to.\n",
      "Janine Okay.\n",
      "Joey And, uhh, maybe the watering can there.\n",
      "Janine Sure.\n",
      "Joey And a couple of these little tiny boxes.\n",
      "Janine Joey? Do you want me to put it all in your room?\n",

      "Rachel Well, I like the pretty little drawing of you in the wedding dress.\n",
      "Monica Thank you.\n",
      "Phoebe Yeah, except your breasts look kinda small. (Points.)\n",
      "Monica Those are my eyes! Those are my breasts. (Points.)\n",
      "Phoebe Oh! Yeah! (Monica glares at her.)\n",
      "Ross Well, why don’t you just start with something simple. Like umm, Monica from the moment I met you, I knew I loved you.\n",
      "Chandler Yeah, I’m not sure I can do that.\n",
      "Ross ...everyone, this is Chandler!\n",
      "Fat Monica Hi, I'm Ross's little sister.\n",
      "Chandler (seeing her) Okay.\n",
      "Rachel Okay. Okay. Okay. Umm, maybe you can start with, \"Chandler, even though we were friends; there was a part of me that always knew I wanted more.\"\n",
      "Chandler All right, there’s a nuclear holocaust, I’m the last man on Earth. Would you go out with me?\n",
      "Monica Ennnh.\n",
      "Monica Ooh, are we allowed to lie in the vows?!\n",
      "Phoebe Well maybe you don’t talk about your feelings back then. Maybe you just say something about y’know all the things that he’s taught you. Like… (They all try to think about one example and don’t succeed.) Or all the things you taught him.\n",
      "Monica Now everybody knows the basic erogenous zones. (She starts labelling them) You got one, two three, four (Chandler is shocked to find out there’s more than three), five, six, and seven!\n",
      "Chandler (shocked) There are seven?! (Points to one) That’s one?\n",
      "Monica It’s kind of an important one!\n",
      "Chandler Oh, y’know-y’know what, I was looking at it upside down.\n",
      "Rachel Well, y’know, sometimes that helps. (She realises what that could’ve meant.)\n",
      "Monica All right. Umm, you could uh start out with a little 1, a 2, a 1-2-3, 3, 5, a 4, a 3-2, 2, a 2-4-6, 2-4-6, 4, (Rachel starts getting worked up) 2, 2, 4-7, 5-7, 6-7, 7 …7..…7…7-7-7-7-7-7-7-7-7-7-7-7…(mouths 7)! (They both lean back on the couch satisfied.)\n",
      "Joey Oh, I got it! How about saying something like, \"Monica…\n",
      "Chandler (writing) Monica…\n",
      "Joey \"…when I look back over our time together…\"\n",
      "Chandler (writes what Joey said and waits for him to go on) Yeah?\n",
      "Joey Well, I can’t do everything! Look back over your time together.\n",
      "Phoebe Oh, look, twins. Hi, guys. Oh, cute, cute.\n",
      "Monica No fair. I don't even have one. How come they get two?\n",
      "Chandler You'll get one.\n",
      "Monica Oh yeah? When?\n",
      "Chandler All right. I'll tell you what. When we're 40, if neither one of us are married, what do you say you and I get together and have one?\n",
      "Monica Why won't I be married when I'm 40?\n",
      "Chandler Oh, no, no. I just meant hypothetically.\n",
      "Monica Ok, hypothetically, why won't I be married when I'm 40?\n",
      "Chandler No, no, no.\n",
      "Monica What is it? Is there something fundamentally unmarriable about me?\n",
      "Chandler (trapped) Uh, uh.\n",
      "Monica Well?\n",
      "Chandler Dear God! This parachute is a knapsack! (throws himself over the back of the chair he was sitting in)\n",
      "Ross (Screaming) I’m getting married today!! Ahh, whoo-hoo!!(He runs back out the door.)\n",
      "Monica (Comes up for below the covers and looks concerned.) Do you think he knew I was here? (Chandler quickly looks at Monica not knowing what to say.)\n",
      "Chandler Nice try.\n",
      "Monica Wait, wait, wait! (She puts a Shriner's hat on the turkey.)\n",
      "Chandler Look, Monica…\n",
      "Monica Look! (She puts a big, yellow pair of sunglasses on the bird.)\n",
      "Chandler This is not going to work.\n",
      "Monica I bet this will work! (She starts dancing and Chandler cracks up.)\n",
      "Chandler You are so great! I love you!\n",
      "Monica What?\n",
      "Chandler Nothing! I said, I said \"You're so great\" and then I just, I just stopped talking!\n",
      "Monica You said you loved me! I can't believe this!\n",
      "Chandler No I didn't!\n",
      "Monica Yes, you did!\n",
      "Chandler No I didn't!\n",
      "Monica You love me!\n",
      "Chandler No I don't! Stop it! Stop it! Stop it! Stop it!\n",
      "Chandler Y’know I was thinking, what if I uh, unpack here?\n",
      "Monica Then all your stuff would be here.\n",
      "Chandler Well, what if all my stuff was here?\n",
      "Monica Then you’d be going back and forth all the time, I mean it doesn’t make any sense.\n",
      "Chandler Okay. What if we lived together and you understand what I’m saying?\n",
      "Monica You wanted it to be a surprise.\n",
      "Chandler Oh my God.\n",
      "Monica Chandler… In all my life… I never thought I would be so lucky. (Starting to cry.) As to…fall in love with my best…my best… There’s a reason why girls don’t do this!\n",
      "Chandler Okay! (He joins her on one knee) Okay! Okay! I'll do it!  Oh God, I thought… (Starting to cry, pauses) Wait a minute, I-I can do this. (Pause) I thought that it mattered what I said or where I said it. Then I realized the only thing that matters is that you, (Pause) you make me happier than I ever thought I could be. (Starting to cry again.) And if you’ll let me, I will spend the rest of my life trying to make you feel the same way. (Pause as he gets out the ring.) Monica, will you marry me?\n",
      "Monica Yes.\n",
      "Joey (yelling through the door) Can we come it yet?! We’re dying out here!\n",
      "Monica Come in! Come in! (Joey, Rachel, and Phoebe burst through the door.) We’re engaged!!!\n",
      "Joey Hey!\n",
      "Ross Hey!\n",
      "Rachel Hey!\n",
      "Phoebe Hey!\n",
      "Rachel Hey, what have you guys been up to?\n",
      "Ross Oh, we were helping Chandler write his vows, but he kicked us out because Joey kept making inappropriate suggestions.\n",
      "Joey How is \"Monica, I love your sweet ass,\" inappropriate?\n",
      "Ross How’s Monica coming along with her vows?\n",
      "Phoebe Well let’s just say its she’s lucky she has a sweet ass, ‘cause she’s not so good at the writing.\n",
      "Ross I can’t believe in four weeks they’re gonna be married!\n",
      "Phoebe Well let’s just hope it works. Y’know nine out of ten marriages end in divorce?\n",
      "Ross Phoebe that’s not true.\n",
      "Phoebe Yeah, you’re right. How’s the Mrs.?\n",
      "Rachel I can’t believe they’ve been together for three years.\n",
      "Joey (shocked) Has it been that long?!\n",
      "Ross Believe me, it seems like less because they hid it from us for so long.\n",
      "Joey Hey, it's me! I'm comin' in!\n",
      "Chandler I've had a very long, hard day.\n",
      "Joey Ahh, I'm gonna go get some chicken. Want some?\n",
      "Chandler Ahh, no thanks. No chicken, bye-bye then.\n",
      "Joey Okay.\n",
      "Chandler Are you okay? I'm so sorry, he wouldn't leave. He kept asking me about chicken.\n",
      "Monica Chicken? I could eat some chicken.\n",
      "Chandler Hey Joe!\n",
      "Chandler Yeah, can I get a 3-piece, some cole slaw, some beans, and a Coke—(Yelps in pain as Monica grabs him underwater)—Diet Coke.\n",
      "Rachel I don’t know why they didn’t just tell us.\n",
      "Joey I know! I mean it’s not like we weren’t cool about it.\n",
      "Joey (To Chandler) You?! (To Monica) And-and you?!\n",
      "Monica Yes, but you cannot tell anyone! No one knows!\n",
      "Joey How?! When?!\n",
      "Chandler It happened in London.\n",
      "Joey IN LONDON!!!\n",
      "Chandler The reason we didn't tell anyone was because we didn't want to make a big deal out of it.\n",
      "Joey But it is a big deal!! I have to tell someone!\n",
      "Chandler No-no-no-no-no! You can't!\n",
      "Monica Please? Please?! We just don't want to deal with telling everyone, okay? Just promise you won't tell.\n",
      "Joey All right! Man, this is unbelievable!\n",
      "Monica (on phone) I can't wait to be with you!  I'll just tell Rachel I'm gonna be doing laundry for a couple of hours.\n",
      "Chandler (on phone) Laundry. Huh. Is that my new nickname? (Rachel is absolutely stunned, she opens her mouth in absolute amazement.)\n",
      "Monica (on phone) Awww, y'know what your nickname is, Mr. Big…\n",
      "Rachel Arghh!! (She quickly hangs up the phone and starts to pace around wondering what to do.)\n",
      "Phoebe (looking out the window) Oh, look! There's Monica and Chandler! (Starts yelling.) Hey! Hey, you guys! Hey! (Chandler and Monica start taking each other's clothes off.) Ohh!! Ohh! Ahh-ahhh!!\n",
      "Rachel What?!\n",
      "Phoebe (screaming) Ahhh!! Chandler and Monica!! Chandler and Monica!!\n",
      "Rachel Oh my God!\n",
      "Phoebe CHANDLER AND MONICA!!!!\n",
      "Rachel OH MY GOD!!!\n",
      "Phoebe OH!! MY EYES!!! MY EYES!!!!\n",
      "Rachel Phoebe!! Phoebe!! It's okay!! It's okay!!\n",
      "Phoebe NO! THEY'RE DOING IT!!!\n",
      "Rachel I KNOW!! I KNOW!! I KNOW!\n",
      "Phoebe YOU KNOW?!!!\n",
      "Rachel Yes, I know! And Joey knows! But Ross doesn't know so you have to stop screaming!!\n",
      "Ross (entering) What's going on?\n",
      "Phoebe and Rachel Ohhh!!!\n",
      "Rachel (trying to divert his attention from the window by jumping up and down) HI!! Hi!\n",
      "Ross What?! What?!\n",
      "Rachel Nothing! Oh God, we're just so excited that you want to get this apartment!\n",
      "Ross Actually, it looks really good. (Turns towards the window and now Phoebe starts jumping to divert his attention.)\n",
      "Phoebe (Screaming incoherently.) Get in here!!! (Motions to join her and Rachel.)\n",
      "Phoebe Okay, so now they know that you know and they don't know that Rachel knows?\n",
      "Joey Yes, but y'know what? It doesn't matter who knows what. Now, enough of us know that we can just tell them that we know! Then all the lying and the secrets would finally be over!\n",
      "Phoebe Or, we could not tell them we know and have a little fun of our own\n",
      "Rachel All right honey, we'd better go if we wanna catch that movie.\n",
      "Monica Bye!\n",
      "All Bye!\n",
      "Phoebe Bye Chandler! (She walks up to him.) (Quietly.) I miss you already. (She pinches his butt.)\n",
      "Chandler (after they've left) Okay, did you see that?! With the inappropriate and the pinching!!\n",
      "Monica Actually, I did!\n",
      "Chandler Okay, so now do you believe that she's attracted to me?\n",
      "Monica Ohhh, oh my God! Oh my God! She knows about us!\n",
      "Chandler Phoebe knows about us!\n",
      "Joey Well I didn't tell them!\n",
      "Monica Them?! Who's them?\n",
      "Joey Uhhh, Phoebe and Joey.\n",
      "Monica Joey!\n",
      "Joey And Rachel. I would've told you but they made me promise not to tell!\n",
      "Monica Oh man, they think they are so slick messing with us! But see they don't know that we know that they know! So…\n",
      "Chandler Ahh yes, the messers become the messies!\n",
      "Phoebe I'll have to get back to you on that. Okay, bye! (Hangs up.) Oh my God! He wants me to come over and feel his bicep and more!\n",
      "Rachel Are you kidding?!\n",
      "Phoebe No!\n",
      "Rachel I can not believe he would do that to Mon—Whoa! (She stops suddenly and slowly turns to point at Joey. Joey is avoiding her eyes.) Joey, do they know that we know?\n",
      "Joey No.\n",
      "Rachel Joey!\n",
      "Joey They know you know.\n",
      "Rachel Ugh, I knew it! Oh I cannot believe those two!\n",
      "Phoebe God, they thought they can mess with us! They're trying to mess with us?! They don't know that we know they know we know! (Joey just shakes his head.) Joey, you can't say anything!\n",
      "Joey I couldn't even if I wanted too.\n",
      "Chandler Listen, this is totally getting out of hand! Okay? She wants me to put lotion on her!\n",
      "Monica She's bluffing!\n",
      "Chandler Look, she's not backing down! She went like this! (He does a little mimic of her dance.)\n",
      "Phoebe He's not backing down. He went to get lotion.\n",
      "Joey (entering the hall) Oh man! Aren't you guys done yet?!\n",
      "Rachel Joey look, just look at it this way, the sooner Phoebe breaks Chandler the sooner this is all over and out in the open.\n",
      "Joey Ooh!\n",
      "Rachel Okay!\n",
      "Joey I like that! (To Phoebe) Oh, okay! Show him your bra! He's afraid of bras! Can't work 'em! (He swiftly rips open the front of Phoebe's dress revealing her bra.)\n",
      "Phoebe Joey! (Examining the dress.) Wow, you didn’t rip off any buttons.\n",
      "Joey It's not my first time.\n",
      "Monica You go back out there and you seduce her till she cracks!\n",
      "Chandler Okay, give me a second! (Pause) Did you clean up in here?\n",
      "Monica Of course.\n",
      "Chandler Oh, you're-you're going?\n",
      "Phoebe Umm, not without you, lover. (She slowly walks over to him and is showcasing her bra.) So, this is my bra.\n",
      "Chandler (swallowing hard) It's very, very nice. Well, come here. I'm very happy were gonna have all the sex.\n",
      "Phoebe You should be. I'm very bendy. (Pause) I'm gonna kiss you now.\n",
      "Chandler Not if I kiss you first.\n",
      "Phoebe Ooh.\n",
      "Chandler Well, I guess there's nothing left for us to do but-but kiss.\n",
      "Phoebe Here it comes. Our first kiss.\n",
      "Chandler Okay! Okay! Okay! You win! You win!! I can't have sex with ya!\n",
      "Phoebe And why not?!\n",
      "Chandler Because I'm in love with Monica!!\n",
      "Phoebe You're-you're what?!\n",
      "Chandler Love her! That's right, I…LOVE…HER!!! I love her!! (They walk together and hug.) I love you, Monica.\n",
      "Monica I love you too Chandler. (They kiss.)\n",
      "Phoebe I just—I thought you guys were doing it, I didn't know you were in love!\n",
      "Joey So that's it! It's over! Everybody knows!\n",
      "Monica Well actually, Ross doesn't.\n",
      "Chandler Yes, and we'd appreciate it if no one told him yet.\n",
      "Ross (He notices something through the window.) No! No! Wh… What are you doing?!! (Dr. Ledbetter is slowly backing away.) GET OFF MY SISTER!!!!!!!!!!!!!\n",
      "Phoebe Y’know, you’re friend’s getting married, it’s gotta change things.\n",
      "Rachel You really think it would be that different?\n",
      "Phoebe How could it not be? I mean pretty soon they’re gonna be having kids, and then they’re just gonna be hanging out with other couples who have kids. And then maybe they’re gonna have to leave the city to be near a Volvo dealership.\n",
      "Rachel Well, things change.\n",
      "Joey I don’t want them to move to a Volvo dealership!\n",
      "Ross It’ll be okay Joe.\n",
      "Joey I’m sorry, I just…I like things the way they are.\n",
      "Rachel Hey, who's this little naked guy?\n",
      "Ross That little naked guy would be me.\n",
      "Rachel Aww, look at the little thing.\n",
      "Ross Yes, yes, fine, that is my penis. Can we be grown-ups now?\n",
      "Chandler Who are those people?\n",
      "Ross Got me.\n",
      "Monica Oh, that's Nana, right there in the middle. (Reads the back) 'Me and the gang at Java Joe's'.\n",
      "Rachel Wow, Monica, you look just like your grandmother. How old was she there?\n",
      "Monica Let's see, 1939... yeah, 24, 25?\n",
      "Ross Looks like a fun gang. (They all look at each other and smile)\n",
      "Joey Ooh, look-look-look-look-look! I got Monica naked!\n",
      "Ross (looking) Nono, that would be me again.\n",
      "Monica Hey, you guys!\n",
      "Phoebe Hey.\n",
      "Joey Hey.\n",
      "Chandler What’s going on?\n",
      "Rachel Well, we were just talkin’ about you guys gettin’ married and how great it is.\n",

      "Ross (To Chandler) Oh man, this is hilarious.\n",
      "Monica Chandler!!\n",
      "Chandler Don’t worry honey, we’ll make yours funnier.\n",
      "Chandler Okay, what do you guys think?\n",
      "Ross (quietly) Dude!\n",
      "Joey (starting to cry) I have never known love like this.\n",
      "Chandler You really like it?\n",
      "Ross Dude! How-how did you write this?\n",
      "Chandler I stole Monica’s and changed the name.\n",
      "Ross You can’t do that!\n",
      "Joey If he goes first he can!\n",

      "Phoebe (feels his arm) Yeah the material feels so soft—hello Mr. Bicep! Have you been working out?\n",
      "Chandler Well, I try to y'know, squeeze things. (Phoebe giggles uncontrollably.) Are you okay?\n",
      "Phoebe Well, if you really wanna know, I'm—Oh! I can't tell you this.\n",
      "Chandler Phoebe, it's me. You can tell me anything.\n",
      "Phoebe Well actually you're the one person I can't tell this too. And the one person I want to the most.\n",
      "Chandler What's going on?\n",
      "Phoebe I think it's just y'know that I haven't been with a guy in so long and how sometimes you're looking for something and you just don’t even see that it's right there in front of you sipping coffee—Oh no, have I said to much? Well it's just something to think about. I know I will.\n",
      "Monica You are so cute! How did you get to be so cute?\n",
      "Chandler Well, my Grandfather was Swedish and my Grandmother was actually a tiny little bunny.\n",
      "Monica Okay, now you're even cuter!!\n",
      "Chandler Y'know that is a popular opinion today I must say.\n",
      "Monica What?\n",
      "Chandler The weirdest thing happened at the coffee house, I think, I think Phoebe was hitting on me.\n",
      "Monica What are you talking about?\n",
      "Chandler I'm telling you I think Phoebe thinks I'm foxy.\n",
      "Monica That's not possible!\n",
      "Chandler Ow!\n",
      "Monica I'm sorry it's just, Phoebe just always thought you were, you were charming in a, in a sexless kind of way.\n",
      "Chandler Oh, y'know I-I can't hear that enough.\n",
      "Monica I'm sorry, I think that you just misunderstood her.\n",
      "Chandler No, I didn't misunderstand, okay? She was all over me! She touched my bicep for crying out loud!\n",
      "Monica This bicep?\n",
      "Chandler Well it's not flexed right now!\n",
      "Rachel Hey Mon, what are you doing now? Wanna come see a movie with us?\n",

      "Chandler Sure, I'll do it with ya.\n",
      "Monica Okay.\n",
      "Rachel Okay great, hold on a sec! (She runs to her room and returns carrying a huge bag of laundry.) Oh, here you go! You don't mind do ya? That would really help me out a lot! Thanks!\n",
      "Monica I mean I-I don't I think I have enough quarters.\n",
      "Phoebe I have quarters! (She holds up a bag of quarters.)\n",
      "Ross (entering) Hey!\n",
      "Rachel Hey Ross! Any word on the apartment yet?\n",
      "Ross Well, I called over there and it turns out Ugly Naked Guy is subletting it himself and he's already had like a hundred applicants.\n",
      "Rachel Oh.\n",
      "Ross No-no, I got the edge. I know it's not exactly ethical but I sent him a little bribe to\n",
      "Monica Oh, is it that pinball machine with the big bow on it?\n",
      "Ross No.\n",
      "Chandler That new mountain bike?\n",
      "Ross No.\n",
      "Monica Well what did you send?\n",
      "Ross A basket of mini-muffins.\n",
      "Phoebe But there's a whole table of mini-muffin baskets. Which one did you send?\n",
      "Ross The small one.\n",
      "Rachel What?! You-you actually thought that basket was gonna get you the apartment?\n",
      "Ross Well yeah! Someone sent us a basket at work once and people went crazy over those little muffins. It was the best day.\n",
      "Chandler Your work makes me sad.\n",
      "Ross Oh man! I want that place so much!! I was so sure that was gonna work! There's twelve bucks I'll never see again! (Exits.)\n",
      "Rachel All right honey, we'd better go if we wanna catch that movie.\n",
      "Monica Bye!\n",
      "All Bye!\n",
      "Phoebe Bye Chandler! (She walks up to him.) (Quietly.) I miss you already. (She pinches his butt.)\n",
      "Chandler (after they've left) Okay, did you see that?! With the inappropriate and the pinching!!\n",
      "Monica Actually, I did!\n",
      "Chandler Okay, so now do you believe that she's attracted to me?\n"

      "Chandler So do I.\n",
      "Chandler I'm gonna put on some music.\n",
      "Phoebe Maybe, maybe I'll dance for you. (She starts doing a rather suggestive and seductive dance that's silly at the same time.)\n",
      "Chandler You look good.\n",
      "Phoebe Thanks! Y'know, that when you say things like that it makes me wanna rip that sweater vest right off!\n",
      "Chandler Well, why don't we move this into the bedroom?\n",
      "Phoebe Really?\n",

      "Rachel Okay!\n",
      "Joey I like that! (To Phoebe) Oh, okay! Show him your bra! He's afraid of bras! Can't work 'em! (He swiftly rips open the front of Phoebe's dress revealing her bra.)\n",
      "Phoebe Joey! (Examining the dress.) Wow, you didn’t rip off any buttons.\n",
      "Joey It's not my first time.\n",

      "Chandler Okay, give me a second! (Pause) Did you clean up in here?\n",
      "Monica Of course.\n",
      "Chandler Oh, you're-you're going?\n",
      "Phoebe Umm, not without you, lover. (She slowly walks over to him and is showcasing her bra.) So, this is my bra.\n",
      "Chandler (swallowing hard) It's very, very nice. Well, come here. I'm very were gonna be having all the sex.\n",
      "Phoebe You should be. I'm very bendy. (Pause) I'm gonna kiss you now.\n",
      "Chandler Not if I kiss you first.\n",

      "Chandler Love her! That's right, I…LOVE…HER!!! I love her!! (They walk together and hug.) I love you, Monica.\n",
      "Monica I love you too Chandler. (They kiss.)\n",
      "Phoebe I just—I thought you guys were doing it, I didn't know you were in love!\n",
      "Joey Dude!\n",
      "Chandler And hats off to Phoebe. Quite a competitor. (Pause) And might I say your breasts are still showing.\n",
      "Phoebe God! (She turns and buttons up.)\n",
      "Joey All right! So that's it! It's over! Everybody knows!\n",
      "Monica Well actually, Ross doesn't.\n",
      "Chandler Yes, and we'd appreciate it if no one told him yet.\n",
      "Ross A new place for a new Ross. I'm gonna have you and all the guys from work over once it's y'know, furnished.\n",
      "Dr. Ledbetter I must say it's nice to see you back on your feet.\n",
      "Ross Well I am that. And that whole rage thing is definitely behind me.\n",
      "Dr. Ledbetter I wonder if its time for you to rejoin our team at the museum?\n",
      "Ross Oh Donald that-that would be great. I am totally ready to come back to work. I—What? (He notices something through the window.) No! Wh… What are you doing?!! (Dr. Ledbetter is slowly backing away.) GET OFF MY SISTER!!!!!!!!!!!!!\n",

      "Chandler Well y'know a lot of those Muppets don't have thumbs.\n",

      "Joey Well, yeah, it was a really nice thing and all, but it made you feel really good right?\n",
      "Phoebe Yeah. So?\n",
      "Joey It made you feel good, so that makes it selfish. Look, there's no unselfish good deeds, sorry.\n",
      "Phoebe Yes there are! There are totally good deeds that are selfless.\n",
      "Joey Well, may I ask for one example?\n",
      "Phoebe Yeah, it's… Y'know there's—no you may not!\n",

      "Emily Ross, I'm only ringing to say stop harassing my relatives. Good-bye!\n",

      "Rachel Maybe Joey's right. Maybe all good deeds are selfish.\n",
      "Phoebe I will find a selfless good deed! 'Cause I just gave birth to three children and I will not let them be raised in a world where Joey is right!\n",
      "Chandler (entering) Hey, Monica? Can I ask you a cooking question?\n",

      "Rachel Chandler! (Pause) Is he?\n",
      "Monica Well, y'know I-I-I think I'm gonna respect the privacy of my new secret boyfriend.\n",
      "Chandler Why?! I mean if this guy was me and it was me who had learned that it was me who was the best you'd ever had, I'd be going like this. (He jumps up onto the table and starts doing his happy dance.)\n",
      "Ross All right Emily, as much as I love you, I'm sorry, I can't move to London without Ben.\n",
      "Emily I understand that would be difficult.\n",
      "Ross Yeah, would you please consider moving here? I mean you were gonna move here anyway, why can't you just do that?\n",
      "Emily I don't know, it's just…\n",
      "Ross Oh-oh-okay, but-but I know, that even though I've been a-a complete idiot up 'til now, I mean, I mean you-you-you have to come here. You have to come here so we can work this out.\n",
      "Emily All right.\n",
      "Ross All right, did you just say all right?\n",
      "Emily I did. Now I'm the idiot.\n",
      "Ross Oh, Emily that is, that is so great. It's gonna be so great! We're gonna be like-like-like two idiots in love!\n",
      "Emily Ross, there's one thing that really scares me still.\n",
      "Ross Yes, tell me.\n",
      "Emily Well, you have to understand how humiliating it was for me up on that altar in front of my entire family, all my friends.\n",
      "Ross I know. I am, I am so sorry.\n",
      "Emily And then after decided to forgive you, seeing you at the airport catching our plane with her.\n",
      "Ross Again, very sorry.\n",
      "Emily I mean, I can't-I can't be in the same room as her! It drives me mad just thinking of you being in the same room as her!\n",
      "Ross Emily, there is nothing between Rachel and me. Okay? I love you.\n",
      "Emily All right. I'll come to New York and we'll try and make this work.\n",
      "Ross Oh that is so great! That's…\n",
      "Emily (interrupting him) As long as you don't see Rachel anymore.\n",
      "Ross So I asked Emily if she would come to New York, and she said yes.\n",
      "Chandler Yes!\n",
      "Phoebe Ooh-ohh!\n",
      "Monica Great!\n",
      "Ross No-no-no! Only if I promise never to see Rachel again.\n",
      "Phoebe Why?\n",
      "Monica What?! You can't—what did you tell her?\n",
      "Ross I told her I'd have to think about it. I mean, how the hell am I supposed to make this kind of a decision? (They're all quiet.) I'm actually asking you!\n",
      "Chandler Well, you can't just not see Rachel anymore, she's one of your best friends.\n",
      "Monica Yeah! But, he can't not exactly see Emily, I mean that's his wife.\n",
      "Phoebe Yeah.\n",
      "Chandler That's true!\n",
      "Phoebe Yeah, but you've known Rachel since High School and you cannot just cut her out of your life.\n",
      "Chandler That's true!\n",
      "Monica No, you cannot.\n",
      "Ross Thanks for the help, problem solved. (Wipes his hands.)\n",

      "Monica Oh hey Joey! We've been watching all day, when are you gonna be on TV?\n",
      "Joey See, there was kind of a mix up in my agent's office, but I'm still on TV and that's good exposure.\n",
      "Monica (Looking at the TV) You're not on TV.\n",
      "Joey Oh, uh, okay, how, how about now? (He waves his hand in front of the woman next to him and you can now see his arm on TV.)\n",

      "Monica (entering) Hi Chandler.\n",
      "Chandler Hey!\n",

      "Monica Yeah, so?\n",
      "Chandler Well I just, thought maybe you'd wanna book some time with the best you'd ever had.\n",
      "Monica Y'know what, champ? I think I'll pass.\n",
      "Chandler Why?\n",
      "Monica Why? (She hops into the living room and imitates Chandler's happy dance.)\n",

      "Phoebe (on phone from Central Perk) Hey Joey, I just wanted to let you know that I found a selfless good deed. I just went down to the park and I let a bee sting me.\n",
      "Joey What?! What good is that gonna do anybody?\n",
      "Phoebe Well, it helps the bee look tough in front of his bee friends. The bee is happy and I am definitely not.\n",
      "Joey Now, y'know the bee probably died after he stung ya.\n",

Now if you've been enjoying the performance of Cirque Du Soleil, (As he is speaking, Joey and the volunteer getting into a shoving match.) and you'd like to see more of the same kind of programming, it's very simple. All you have to do (Joey is knocked down.) is call in your pledge and at that time tell the operator, one of our volunteers, what kind of programming you'd like to… (Just as the volunteer sits down, Joey pulls him to the ground.)\n",
      "Ross (entering) Okay, that's it. I cannot make this decision! It is too difficult, so I'm just gonna leave it entirely to the gods of fate. (He holds up and starts shaking a…)\n",
      "Monica A Magic Eight ball?! You can't be serious, you can't make this decision with a toy!\n",
      "Phoebe Ooh, it's not a toy.\n",
      "Ross Well, I don't know what else to do. I mean, I either keep my wife and lose one of my-my-my best friends or I keep my friend and get divorced the second time before I'm 30! So-so if anyone has-has a better suggestion, let's hear it! 'Cause I-I got nothing! All right, don't be shy, any suggestion will do. (There are none.) Okay then. Here we go. Magic 8 Ball, should I never see Rachel again? (He turns it over and reads the answer) Ask again later. Later is not good enough. (He shakes it up again and reads the answer.) Ask again later. What the hell! This is broken! It-it is broken!\n",
      "Monica All right, let me see. (She grabs the 8 ball.) Will Chandler have sex tonight? (Reads the answer.) Don't count on it. Seems like it works to me.\n",

      "Joey $200? Are you sure Pheebs? I mean, after what Sesame Street did to ya?\n",
      "Phoebe Oh, I'm still mad at them but I also now that they bring happiness to lots of kids who's moms didn't kill themselves, so by supporting them, I'm doing a good thing, but I'm not happy about it. So there, a selfless good deed.\n",
      "Joey And you don't a little good about donating the money?\n",
      "Phoebe No, it sucks. I was saving up to buy a hamster.\n",
      "Joey A hamster? What, those things are like 10 bucks.\n",
      "Phoebe Yeah, not the one I had my eye on.\n",
      "Gary Collins (on TV.) It looks like we have surpassed last year's pledge total! Thank you viewers! The pledge that did it was taken by one of our volunteers…(He walks over to where Joey is sitting.) Oh boy! And may I say one of our sharpest dressed volunteers, (Joey stands up.) Mr. Joseph Tribbiani!\n",
      "Phoebe Oh, look-look, Joey's on TV! Isn't that great? My pledge got Joey on TV! Oh that makes me feel—Oh no! (Realizes that her deed made her happy and therefore it's selfish and covers her mouth in horror.)\n",
      "Chandler (entering) Look, maybe I got carried away before. But there's something you gotta know. If I'm the best, it's only because you've made me the best.\n",
      "Monica Keep talking.\n",
      "Chandler I mean I was nothing before you. Call the other girls and ask. Which wouldn't take long. But when I'm with you, and we're together, OH…MY…GOD.\n",
      "Monica Really?\n",
      "Chandler Oh-aw my God! Now, I understand if you never want to sleep with me again, but that would be wrong. We're too good! We owe it, to sex!\n",
      "Monica Well, if we owe it? (She throws down her cleaning stuff and jumps into his arms.) Oh my… When is Joey gonna be home?\n",
      "Chandler Well, I was kinda hoping we could do this without him. (She starts to take off her latex gloves.) Oh no-no-no, leave the gloves on.\n",
      "Monica But, I just cleaned the bathroom.\n",
      "Chandler Yeah, why don't we lose the gloves.\n",
      "Monica Yeah. (She takes them off.)\n",
      "Chandler All right, let's show them how it's done.\n",

      "Ross For what?\n",
      "Rachel For Stella! Remember? She's gettin' her grove back in like 20 minutes.\n",
      "Ross Yeah, I uh, totally forgot about that. You mind if I take a rain check? I'm waiting for a call from Emily.\n",
      "Rachel Sure. I guess. Hey, I hear you don't have to go to London. Yay!\n",
      "Ross It's not that easy, there's still a lot of relationship stuff.\n",
      "Rachel Like what?\n",
      "Ross Just stuff. Y'know kinda what Emily wants.\n",
      "Rachel Well, why don't you talk to me about it, maybe I can help.\n",
      "Ross No. No. You-you can't help. I mean, I kinda have to do this without your help.\n",
      "Rachel Well, I-I know you can do that too. I'm just, I'm just saying if you need somebody to talk to… Hi!\n",
      "Ross Thanks.\n",
      "Rachel Ross? Look, whatever this relationship stuff that Emily wants, just give it to her. Come on, the bottom line here is that you love her. So just fix whatever she wants fixed. Just do it. (The phone starts ringing.) I mean, you're gonna have to try. You'll just gonna hate yourself if you don't. (The phone keeps ringing.) Oh come on answer it! It's driving me crazy!\n",
      "Ross (answering the phone.) Hello. (Listens) Hi sweetie. (Listens.) Good. Look umm, yes I've been thinking about that thing that you wanted me to do and, I can do it. (Rachel gives him a thumbs up.) So will you come to New York? (Rachel wants to know what she said, and he gives her a thumbs up and she goes over and hugs him.

      "Monica Uh, no. Loosely translated 'We should do this again' means 'You will never see me naked'.\n",
      "Rachel Since when?\n",
      "Joey Since always. It's like dating language. Y'know, like 'It's not you' means 'It is you'.\n",

      "Monica Uh, Ross.\n",

      "All Eww!\n",
      "Phoebe I know! I know, I opened it up and there it was, just floating in there, like this tiny little hitch-hiker!\n",
      "Chandler Well, maybe it's a contest, y'know? Like, collect all five?\n",
      "Phoebe Does, um, anyone wanna see?\n",

      "Rachel It's worse than the thumb!\n",
      "Chandler Hey, this is so unfair!\n",
      "Monica Oh, why is it unfair?\n",
      "Chandler So I have a flaw! Big deal! Like Joey's constant knuckle-cracking isn't annoying? And Ross, with his over-pronouncing every single word? And Monica, with that snort when she laughs? I mean, what the hell is that thing? ...I accept all those flaws, why can't you accept me for this?\n",
      "Joey ...Does the knuckle-cracking bother everybody?\n",
      "Rachel Well, I-I could live without it.\n",
      "Joey Well, is it, like, a little annoying, or is it like when Phoebe chews her hair?\n",
      "Ross Oh, now, don't listen to him, Pheebs, I think it's endearing.\n",

      "Paula Waitwait.. we talking about the coyotes here? All right, a cow got through!\n",
      "Monica Can you believe it? ...Y'know what? I just don't feel the thing. I mean, they feel the thing, I don't feel the thing.\n",
      "Paula Honey.. you should always feel the thing. Listen, if that's how you feel about the guy, Monica, dump him!\n",
      "Monica I know.. it's gonna be really hard.\n",
      "Paula Well, he's a big boy, he'll get over it.\n",
      "Monica No, he'll be fine. It's the other five I'm worried about.\n",
      "Joey Do you have any respect for your body?\n",
      "Ross Don't you realise what you're-you're doing to yourself?\n",
      "Chandler Hey, y'know, I have had it with you guys and your cancer and your emphysema and your heart disease. The bottom line is, smoking is cool, and you know it.\n",
      "Rachel (holding the phone out to Chandler) Chandler? It's Alan, he wants to speak to you.\n",
      "Chandler Really? He does? (taking the phone) Hey, buddy, what's up! Oh, she told you about that, huh. Well, yeah, I have one now and then. Well, yeah, now. Well, it's not that big- ..well, that's true,.. Gee, y'know, no-one- no-one's ever put it like that before. Well, okay, thanks! (He hands the phone back and stubs out his cigarette.)\n",
      "Rachel (to Ross, who has wandered up) God, he's good.\n",
      "Ross If only he were a woman.\n",
      "Rachel Yeah.\n",
      "Chandler Ooh, Lambchop. How old is that sock? If I had a sock on my hand for thirty years it'd be talking too.\n",
      "Ross Okay. I think it's time to change somebody's nicotine patch. (Does so.)\n",
      "Monica (entering) Hey. Where's Joey?\n",
      "Chandler Joey ate my last stick of gum, so I killed him. Do you think that was wrong?\n",
      "Rachel I think he's across the hall.\n",
      "Monica Thanks. (Goes to fetch him.)\n",
      "Ross (finishing changing Chandler's nicotine patch) There y'go.\n",

      "Mr. Tribbiani Remember when you were a little kid, I used to take you to the navy yard and show you the big ships?\n",
      "Joey Since then?!\n",
      "Mr. Tribbiani No, it's only been six years. I just wanted to put a nice memory in your head so you'd know that I wasn't always such a terrible guy. ...Joe. Y'ever been in love?\n",
      "Joey ...I d'know.\n",
      "Mr. Tribbiani Then y'haven't. You're burning your tomatoes.\n",
      "Joey You're one to talk. (Puts the mushrooms in a saucepan)\n",
      "Mr. Tribbiani Joe, your dad's in love big time. And the worst part of it is, it's with two different women.\n",
      "Joey Oh man. Please tell me one of 'em is Ma.\n",
      "Mr. Tribbiani Of course, course one of 'em's Ma. What's the matter with you.\n",
      "Joey It's like if you woke up one day and found out your dad was leading this double life. He's like actually some spy, working for the C.I.A. (Considers) That'd be cool.... This blows!\n",
      "Rachel I know, I mean, why can't parents just stay parents? (She walks over near Chandler and his gaze stays very obviously on her chest) Why do they have to become people? Why do they have... (Notices Chandler) Why can't you stop staring at my breasts?\n",
      "Chandler (Without looking up) What? (Looks up) What?\n",
      "Rachel Did you not get a good enough look the other day?\n",
      "Ross Alright, alright. We're all adults here, there's only one way to resolve this. Since you saw her boobies, I think, uh, you're gonna have to show her your peepee.\n",
      "Chandler Y'know, I don't see that happening?\n",
      "Rachel C'mon, he's right. Tit for tat.\n",

      "Ross Yeah.\n",
      "Chandler Oh, it's nothing, it's a little thing... I hate that guy.\n",
      "Ross What, so he was a little analytical. That's what he does, y'know? C'mon, he's not that bad.\n",
      "Ross Y'see, that's where you're wrong. Why would I marry her if I thought on any level thatthat she was a lesbian?\n",
      "Roger I dunno. Maybe you wanted your marriage to fail.\n",
      "Ross Why? Why would I why? Why? Why? Why?\n",
      "Roger I don't know. Maybe maybe low self-esteem, maybe maybe to compensate for overshadowing a sibling, maybe you...\n",
      "Monica Wait-wait, go back to that sibling thing.\n",
      "Roger Well, I don't know. I mean, it's conceivable that you wanted to sabotage your marriage so that the sibling would feel less of a failure in the eyes of the parents.\n",
      "Ross That that's ridiculous! I don't feel guilty for her failures!\n",
      "Monica Oh! So you think I'm a failure!\n",
      "Phoebe Isn't he good?\n",
      "Ross Nonono, thatthat's not what I was saying...\n",
      "Monica Y'know, all these years, I thought you were on my side. But maybe what you were doing was sucking up to Mom and Dad so they'd keep liking you better!\n",
      "Ross Hey, I married a lesbian to make you look good!\n",
      "Rachel You're right! I mean you're right! It wasn't just the Weebles, but it was the Weeble Play Palace, and and the Weebles' Cruise Ship. Oh, which had this little lifeboat for the Weebles to wobble in.\n",
      "Roger That's tough. Tough stuff. C'mon, Pheebs, we're gonna catch that movie, we gotta get going.\n",
      "Phoebe Oh, okay. Feel better, Rachel, 'kay?\n",
      "Roger Geez, we're gonna be late, sweetie...\n",
      "Phoebe Oh, okay. Listen, thanks for everything, Mon.\n",
      "Monica You're welcome.\n",
      "Roger Listen guys, it was great seeing you again. Mon, um, easy on those cookies, okay? Remember, they're just food, they're not love.\n",
      "Monica Hate that guy! (Throws another cookie)\n",
      "Joey Night, you guys.\n",
      "Chandler Oh look, it's the woman we ordered.\n",
      "Joey Hey. Can, uh, can we help you?\n",

      "Joey I'm Joey Tribbiani.\n",
      "Ronni Oh no, not you, big Joey. Oh my God, you're so much cuter than your pictures! (Joey stares at her) I-I'm, I'm Ronni....Cheese Nip?\n",
      "Chandler Uh, Joey's having an embolism, but I'd go for a Nip, y'know?\n",
      "Ronni Now, y'see, most people, when their pets pass on, they want 'em sorta laid out like they're sleeping. But occasionally you get your person who wants them in a pose. Like, chasing their tail, (Demonstrates) or, uh, jumping to catch a frisbee.\n",
      "Chandler Joey, if I go first, I wanna be looking for my keys.\n",
      "Ronni That's a good one!\n",
      "Mr. Tribbiani Hey, Joe.\n",
      "Joey Dad, Ronni's here.\n",
      "Mr. Tribbiani Huh?\n",
      "Ronni Hi.\n",
      "Mr. Tribbiani Hey! Hello, babe! Wh what're what're you doing here?\n",
      "Ronni Oh, uh, well, you left your good hair at my apartment, I figured you'd need it tomorrow for your meeting. (Hands him the hair)\n",
      "Mr. Tribbiani Thank you. Uh...\n",
      "Chandler So, who's up for a big game of Kerplunk?\n",
      "Ronni Look, I uh, I shouldn'ta come. I-I'd better get going, I don't wanna miss the last train.\n",
      "Mr. Tribbiani I don't want you taking that thing.\n",
      "Ronni Oh, where'm I gonna stay, here?\n",
      "Joey Who-ah-ho.\n",
      "Mr. Tribbiani We'll go to a hotel.\n",
      "Ronni (Shrugs) We'll go to a hotel.\n",
      "Joey No you won't.\n",
      "Ronni No we won't.\n",
      "Joey If you go to a hotel you'll be...doing stuff. I want you right here where I can keep an eye on you.\n",
      "Mr. Tribbiani You're gonna keep an eye on us?\n",
      "Joey That's right, mister, and I don't care how old you are, as long as you're under my roof you're gonna live by my rules. And that means no sleeping with your girlfriend.\n",
      "Ronni Wow. He's strict.\n",
      "Joey Now dad, you'll be in my room, Ronni uh, you can stay in Chandler's room.\n",
      "Ronni Thanks. You're, uh, you're a good kid.\n",
      "Chandler C'mon, I'll show you to my room. ...That sounds so weird when it's not followed by \"No thanks, it's late.\"\n",
      "Joey Okay. Now this is just for tonight. Starting tomorrow, you gotta make a change. This has gone on long enough.\n",
      "Mr. Tribbiani What kinda change?\n",
      "Joey Well, either you break it off with Ronni\n",
      "Mr. Tribbiani I can't do that!\n",
      "Joey Then you gotta come clean with Ma! This is not right!\n",
      "Mr. Tribbiani Yeah, but this is\n",
      "Joey I don't wanna hear it! Now go to my room!\n",
      "Chandler Hey, Kicky. What're you doing?\n",
      "Joey Just trying to get comfortable. I can't sleep in my underwear.\n",
      "Chandler Well, you're gonna.\n",
      "Joey I've been thinking. Y'know, about how I'm always seeing girls on top of girls...\n",
      "Chandler Are they end to end, or tall like pancakes?\n",
      "Joey Y'know what I mean, about how I'm always going out with all these women. And I always figured, when the right one comes along, I'd be able to be a stand-up guy and go the distance, y'know? Now I'm looking at my dad, thinking...\n",
      "Chandler Hey, you're not him. You're you. When they were all over you to go into your father's pipe-fitting business, did you cave?\n",
      "Joey No.\n",
      "Chandler No. You decided to go into the out-of-work actor business. Now that wasn't easy, but you did it! And I'd like to believe that when the right woman comes along, you will have the courage and the guts to say \"No thanks, I'm married.\"\n",
      "Joey You really think so?\n",
      "Chandler Yeah. I really do.\n",
      "Joey Thanks, Chandler. (Snuggles up to him)\n",
      "Chandler Get off!\n",

      "Rachel Perfect. Fasten your seatbelts, it's peepee time. (She goes into Joey and Chandler's apartment, where Mr. Tribbiani is reading the paper) Hey, Mr. Trib.\n",
      "Mr. Tribbiani Hey. Morning, dear.\n",
      "Rachel Chandler Bing? It's time to see your thing.\n",
      "Joey (Runs out in a towel) What's the matter with you?!\n",

      "Chandler (Comes out of his room) What? What?\n",
      "Rachel You were supposed to be in there so I could see your thing!\n",
      "Chandler Sorry, my my thing was in there with me.\n",
      "All Hey, Pheebs.\n",
      "Phoebe Hey.\n",
      "Monica How's it going?\n",
      "Phoebe Good. Oh oh! Roger's having a dinner thing and he wanted me to invite you guys.\n",
      "Phoebe So what's going on?\n",
      "Monica Nothing, um, it's just, um... It's Roger.\n",
      "Ross I dunno, there's just something about...\n",
      "Chandler Basically we just feel that he's...\n",
      "Rachel We hate that guy.\n",
      "All Yeah. Hate him.\n",
      "Ross We're sorry, Pheebs, we're sorry.\n",
      "Phoebe Uh-huh. Okay. Okay, don't you think, maybe, though, it's just that he's so perceptive that it freaks you out?\n",
      "All ...No, we hate him.\n",
      "Rachel We're sorry.\n",
      "Joey Ma! What're you doing here?\n",
      "Mrs. Tribbiani I came to give you this (Gives him a bag of groceries) and this. (Whacks him round the ear)\n",
      "Joey Oww! Big ring!\n",
      "Mrs. Tribbiani Why did you have to fill your father's head with all that garbage about making things right? Things were fine the way they were! There's chicken in there, put it away. For God's sake, Joey, really. (She gives the sofabed a tiny push and it folds away)\n",
      "Joey Hold on, you-you knew?\n",
      "Mrs. Tribbiani Of course I knew! What did you think? Your father is no James Bond. You should've heard some of his cover stories. \"I'm sleeping over at my accountant's,\" I mean, what is that? Please!\n",
      "Joey So then how could you I mean, how could you?!\n",
      "Mrs. Tribbiani Do you remember how your father used to be? Always yelling, always yelling nothing made him happy, nothing made him happy, not that wood shop, not those stupid little ships in the bottle, nothing. Now he's happy! I mean, it's nice, he has a hobby.\n",
      "Joey Ma, I don't mean to be disrespectful, but... what the hell are you talking about?! I mean, what about you?\n",
      "Mrs. Tribbiani Me? I'm fine. Look, honey, in an ideal world, there'd be no her, and your father would look like Sting. And I'll tell you something else. Ever since that poodle-stuffer came along, he's been so ashamed of himself that he's been more attentive, he's been more loving... I mean, it's like every day's our anniversary.\n",
      "Joey I'm...happy...for you?\n",
      "Mrs. Tribbiani Well don't be, because now everything's screwed up. I just want it the way it was.\n",
      "Joey Ma, I'm sorry. I just did what I thought you'd want.\n",
      "Mrs. Tribbiani I know you did, cookie. Oh, I know you did. So tell me. Did you see her?\n",
      "Joey Yeah. You're ten times prettier than she is.\n",
      "Mrs. Tribbiani That's sweet. Could I take her?\n",
      "Joey With this ring? (Her engagement ring.) No contest.\n",
      "Roger What's wrong, sweetie?\n",
      "Phoebe Nothing, nothing.\n",
      "Roger Aaaah, what's wrong, c'mon. (Pats his leg. She lies down and rests her head in his lap)\n",
      "Phoebe It's, I mean, it's nothing, I'm fine. It's my friends. They-they have a liking problem with you. In that, um, they don't.\n",
      "Roger Oh. They don't.\n",
      "Phoebe But they don't see all the wonderfulness that I see. They don't see all the good stuff and all the sweet stuff. They just think you're a little...\n",
      "Roger What?\n",
      "Phoebe Intense and creepy.\n",
      "Roger Oh.\n",
      "Phoebe But I don't. Me, Phoebe.\n",
      "Roger Well, I'm not I'm not at all surprised they feel that way.\n",
      "Phoebe You're not? See, that's why you're so great!\n",
      "Roger Actually it's, it's quite, y'know, typical behaviour when you have this kind of dysfunctional group dynamic. Y'know, this kind of co-dependant, emotionally stunted, sitting in your stupid coffee house with your stupid big cups which, I'm sorry, might as well have nipples on them, and you're like all 'Oh, define me! Define me! Love me, I need love!'.\n",
      "Monica So you talked to your dad, huh.\n",
      "Joey Yeah. He's gonna keep cheating on my ma like she wanted, she's gonna keep pretending she doesn't know even though she does, and my little sister Tina can't see her husband any more because he got a restraining order...which has nothing to do with anything except that I found out today.\n",
      "Rachel Wow.\n",
      "Chandler Things sure have changed here on Waltons mountain.\n",
      "Ross So Joey, you okay?\n",
      "Joey Yeah, I guess. It's just parents, after a certain point, you gotta let go. Even if you know better, you've gotta let them make their own mistakes.\n",
      "Rachel Just think, in a couple of years we get to turn into them.\n",
      "Chandler If I turn into my parents, I'll either be an alcoholic blond chasing after twenty-year-old boys, or... I'll end up like my mom.\n",
      "Phoebe (entering) Hey.\n",
      "All Hey, Pheebs.\n",
      "Monica How's it going?\n",
      "Phoebe Oh, okay, except I broke up with Roger.\n",
      "All Awww.\n",
      "Phoebe Yeah, right.\n",
      "All Aaawwwwww!!\n",
      "Rachel What happened?\n",
      "Phoebe I don't know, I mean, he's a good person, and he can be really sweet, and in some ways I think he is so right for me, it's just... I hate that guy!\n",
      "Phoebe Hey, Joey. What's going on?\n",
      "Joey Clear the tracks for the boobie payback express. Next stop: Rachel Green. (He goes into the bathroom. We hear a scream and he comes out, closely followed by Monica in a towel)\n",
      "Monica Joey!! What the hell were you doing?!\n",
      "Joey Sorry. Wrong boobies.\n",
      "Monica Hello, Joey.\n",
      "Mr. Tribbiani Oh! ...Hello, dear. (She whips the curtain shut in horror)\n",

      "Phoebe Oh, right! Your adoption interview!\n",
      "Monica Yep, we're gonna meet the lady who could be carrying our baby.\n",
      "Joey I can't believe it. When you guys come back, you're gonna have a baby! That is so weird!\n",
      "Chandler And so incorrect!\n",
      "Monica She's only a couple of months pregnant. She liked our application but who knows if she's gonna like us.\n",
      "Ross Come on, she's gonna love you guys!\n",
      "Chandler Uhm, thank you, but we're really trying not to get our hopes up.\n",
      "Monica And a lot could still get in our way.\n",
      "Chandler Yeah. I mean, this girl could decide against adoption or she could like another couple better..\n",
      "Phoebe What are you gonna name the baby?\n",
      "Chandler I can develop a condition in which I talk and talk and no one hears a word.\n",
      "Joey But just think, ok? What if everything goes right? What if this woman does pick you guys?\n",
      "Monica Oh my God. She's gonna pick us!\n",
      "Chandler So we're standing firm on the 'not getting our hopes up'?\n",
      "Monica You know, I know that things could still go wrong but if they don't? If this works out, we're gonna have a baby Chandler, a baby!\n",
      "Chandler Yes, but...\n",
      "Monica Oh my God, it's gonna WORK! We're gonna make it work! I'm gonna be a mummy and (to Chandler) you're gonna be a daddy! All right, I'll see you suckers. I'm gonna get me... A BABY! {she leaves)\n",

      "Phoebe Hey!\n",
      "Joey So... who's your friend?\n",
      "Phoebe Oh, that's Sarah. No, no. Don't you get any ideas, ok? No, I'm not setting you up with any more of my friends!\n",
      "Joey OW, why, why, why?\n",
      "Phoebe Because you'll date her once, sleep with her and then forget she exists!\n",
      "Joey Oh, name one friend of yours that I did that with.\n",
      "Phoebe Mandy.\n",
      "Joey Mandy, uh? Uh... really hot blonde, big boobs?\n",
      "Phoebe No.\n",
      "Joey I know why I don't remember her, huh? (he winks at Rachel)\n",
      "Rachel Do you think I'm someone else?\n",
      "Joey Ok, I may not have treated your friends well in the past, but I have grown up a lot, really. Honest, Rach?\n",
      "Rachel Well, believe it or not, it's true. When Joey and I were together, he was wonderful. He was thoughtful and mature. And for the one week that we went out, he didn't sleep with anybody else!\n",
      "Joey (pointing at himself) Growth!\n",
      "Phoebe Fine, I'll give you her number.\n",
      "Joey Ok, thank you. And I promise you I will not forget this one. (he starts writing on his hand) Mandy.\n",

      "Rachel Oh!\n",
      "Ross (he takes a baby blue beret out of a shopping box and puts it on) How does this look?\n",
      "Rachel Well, it's a little low... pick up a little... (Ross picks it up) a little bit more... (he picks it up again) a little bit more... (he takes it off) There you go! (pause) Now throw it away!\n",
      "Ross C'mon! This looks good!\n",
      "Rachel Ross, please, trust me. I buy 30 fashion magazines a month. Now, I don't know who's running for president or who that... NATO guy is, but I do know that you have to get as far away as you can from that hat.\n",
      "Ross Damnit! I have this date tomorrow night and I have to look cool!\n",
      "Phoebe Well, you know, if you want fashion help, Rachel and I are going shopping tomorrow. You're more than welcome to come with us, right?\n",
      "Ross Really? That would be great. I mean, I have to do something, she kinda teased me about how I dress.\n",
      "Joey I can see why, nice shirt!\n",
      "Ross You're wearing the same shirt.\n",
      "Joey Stupid Gap on every corner!\n",
      "Agency guy Please, make yourself comfortable and I will back in a moment with Erica.\n",
      "Monica Ok, thank you.(the man leaves) Uh, well this is it. Are you OK?\n",
      "Chandler Yeah. Just weird, you know. It's like: \"Hi, I'm Chandler. May I have the human growing inside you?\"\n",
      "Monica Uh, we're gonna be great.\n",
      "Chandler You're gonna be great.\n",
      "Monica Well... obviously!\n",
      "Agency guy (he enters with Erica) Monica, Chandler. I'd like you to meet Erica.\n",
      "Monica Hi. It is so, so nice to meet you.\n",
      "Erica (whispering) Hi...\n",
      "Chandler Thank you so much for agreeing to see us.\n",
      "Erica Hi.\n",
      "Agency guy I'll let you get acquainted.\n",
      "Chandler Ok.\n",
      "Erica So, it's Monica and Chandler. I only know you as file 0W33815-D.\n",
      "Chandler That's what our friends call us.\n",
      "Erica Gosh, you know, you're just such an amazing couple. It's... kind of intimidating.\n",
      "Monica I don't know about that.\n",
      "Erica You're kidding me? I mean, it's enough that you are a doctor. But on top of it, you're married to a reverend?\n",
      "Chandler (astonished) I don't think that's exactly...\n",
      "Monica (overlapping) Let her finish, doctor.\n",
      "Phoebe Hey!\n",
      "Joey Hey.\n",
      "Phoebe Oh, my friend Sarah had a great time last night.\n",
      "Joey Well...\n",
      "Phoebe Yeah! So you're gonna call this one back?\n",
      "Joey Nope.\n",
      "Phoebe What are you talking about? Sarah's great!\n",
      "Joey Oh, really? You know what your great friend did? We're out to dinner, ok? (he starts talking about the date and we can see what happened through a flashback video) We're getting along, having a really nice time. I was thinking she was really cool. And then, out of nowhere...\n",
      "Phoebe That’s it? That’s why you won’t go out with her again? So, she took some fries, big deal!\n",
      "Joey Hey, hey, look! It’s not about a few fries... it’s about what the fries represent.\n",
      "Phoebe What?\n",
      "Joey ALL FOOD!\n",
      "Phoebe I’m sorry, I can’t believe I set you up with such a MONSTER!\n",
      "Joey Hey, hey, hey, hey. Look. I take a girl out, she can order whatever she wants! The more, the better! All right? Just don’t order a Garden salad and then eat my food! That’s a good way to lose some fingers!\n",
      "Phoebe (to Rachel) Oh\n",
      "Rachel Hi\n",
      "Phoebe Thank God you’re here. Listen to this!\n",
      "Rachel what?\n",
      "Phoebe Joey and my friend were out last night and having dinner and she reaches over and takes a few of his fries...\n",
      "Rachel Oh! Oh, no!\n",
      "Phoebe What? You know about the plate thing?\n",
      "Rachel Oh, yeah. Joey doesn’t share food. I mean, just last week we were having breakfast and he had a couple of grapes on his plate and ...\n",
      "Phoebe (to Joey) You wouldn’t let her have a grape?\n",
      "Rachel Oh no! Not me! Emma!\n",
      "Joey (mad and pointing a finger to himself) JOEY DOESN’T SHARE FOOD!\n",
      "Phoebe Well, I still think that it’s a stupid reason not to call someone again. You are calling her! And if you need to, just get an extra plate of fries for the table!\n",
      "Joey (he thinks a little, considering the option and seems to be quite satisfied) I like that! A sharing buffer! Yeah! I’ll order some extra fries! Maybe a plate of onion rings. Yeah. And a shrimp cocktail. And some buffalo wings. Maybe an individual pizza, uh? And some mozzarella sticks. (he looks absorbed in his food thoughts) What were we talking about?\n",
      "Phoebe (to Ross) This place is awesome!\n",
      "Ross You know, we should just go, I’m not gonna find anything here! This stuff is ridiculous!\n",
      "Rachel Ah, this place is great!\n",
      "Phoebe Wow!\n",
      "Ross Rach, come on, I’m not gonna wear any of this! (he picks up a shirt) Nothing silver. (Rachel sighs). Ok? Nothing with hair! (Rachel sighs again) And nothing with padlocks on it! (Rachel heaves a long disappointing sigh).\n",
      "Rachel Ross, look, I know that some of this stuff is out there, but I mean, come on, look at this, look at this sweater! (she picks up a blue sweater). I mean, this is just beautiful!\n",
      "Ross (feeling the fabric) Wow, this is really soft (he looks the price). Three hundred and fifty dollars?\n",
      "Rachel Yeah, down from seven hundred, you are saving like two hundred bucks!\n",
      "Ross Both logic and math are taking a serious hit today.\n",
      "Phoebe (walking to Ross carrying a black leather jacket) Hey, check this out! It’s totally you!\n",
      "Ross Wow!\n",
      "Phoebe Yeah!\n",
      "Ross Actually this looks like pretty good! Yeah!(he turns and watches his back and there’s a sign on the back of the jacket, “boys will be boys”) Boys will be boys?\n",
      "Phoebe What? They will be!\n",
      "Ross All right, that’s it, I’m getting out of here.\n",
      "Rachel No, no, no, no! Ross, wait! Come on! You know, there’s other stuff. Here’s a nice shirt, look at these nice pants...\n",
      "Ross Uh, actually these might look pretty good on me.\n",
      "Rachel Yes, they will! You know what you should do? Just go take a walk, all right? I know your size and I’m... I’m gonna pick up some really good stuff for you.\n",
      "Ross Really?\n",
      "Rachel Yes! And I know what looks sexy on guys. Please, just wear what I suggest, and she’s gonna go nuts for you.\n",
      "Ross So, you’re saying, uh, if I wear these pants I might be getting into hers?\n",
      "Rachel (to Phoebe) Why do men keep talking to me like this?\n",
      "Chandler So, the fact that I am a doctor, and my wife’s a reverend, that’s important to you?\n",
      "Erica Yeah, I read some great applications, but then I thought “who better then a minister to raise a child!”\n",
      "Monica Amen.\n",
      "Chandler Plus I thought the baby would be in good hands with a doctor!\n",
      "Monica Uh, good hands. (she holds Chandler hands) Healing hands.\n",
      "Erica Reverend, can I ask? Does the bible say anything about adoption?\n",
      "Monica It says “Do it!”. And behold she did adopt onto them a baby. And it was good.\n",
      "Erica Wow.\n",
      "Chandler Yeah, wow.\n",
      "Erica I was wondering you both have such serious jobs. (to Monica) Would you have time to take care of a baby and your flock?\n",
      "Monica Oh, you know, my flock is good, I mean, yeah, my flock pretty much takes care of themselves at this point. Good flock. Flock, flock, flock.\n",
      "Erica (to Chandler) Being a doctor must take up a lot of time.\n",
      "Chandler No-ot for me it doesn’t.\n",
      "Agency guy So, how’s everything going in here?\n",
      "Erica We’re great, I think I may have asked all my questions.\n",
      "Agency guy Do you have any question for Erica?\n",
      "Chandler Yeah, actually. So, you read a file that you liked and you gave the agency the serial number and they contacted us?\n",
      "Agency guy Yes, our system assures total anonimity. We’re very proud of it.\n",
      "Chandler You should be. You’re really on top of stuff..\n",
      "Agency guy (to Erica) Well, then if there’s nothing else, then the two of us should talk.\n",
      "Erica Actually, I don’t think we have to.\n",
      "Monica We don’t?\n",
      "Erica Yeah, when I read about you two, I was pretty sure I wanted you, but I just thought we should meet face to face. (to the agency guy). I've made my decision. I choose them.\n",
      "Monica Oh my God, this is great! This is so great! (to Chandler, who looks bewildered). Did you hear that?\n",
      "Chandler Yeah, I did.\n",
      "Monica (to Erica) Hey, thank you. Thank you so much. (they hugs). You are SO going to Heaven!\n",
      "Rachel We got some really great stuff!\n",
      "Phoebe Yeah, yeah but I am not sure about some of the bra's I got.\n",
      "Rachel Oh! Really? Do you wanna try some of them on for me?\n",
      "Phoebe Oh! okay. Wait, are we in Joey's imagination?\n",
      "Rachel (looking into one of her shopping bags) Oh no! I took one of Ross' bags by\n",
      "Phoebe oh, well, Ross probably has it, you can get it from him later.\n",
      "Ross (to Joey) So? What do you think? (Shows himself - Joey observes him with a strange look on his face.)\n",
      "Joey I think were not wearing the same shirt anymore!!\n",
      "Ross (not getting it) Yeah! Yeah! Rachel picked it out for me. She told me to trust her and you know what? I'm glad I did! I turned quite a few heads on my way over here.\n",
      "Joey (now laughing a little) Dude, I really don't think you should be wearing that.\n",
      "Ross Oh, I see, somebody is afraid of a little competition with the ladies?\n",
      "Joey (looking a little agitated now) Looks like someone IS the ladies!!\n",
      "Ross You're just jealous because you couldn't pull this off. Yeah, now if you'll excuse me (getting up and taking his coat) I have a date. (As he is walking out, everyone turns and stares at him) See? (To Joey) ALL eyes on ME!\n",
      "Chandler We are NOT signing those papers.\n",
      "Monica Why not?\n",
      "Chandler It's wrong. They made a mistake. They think we're somebody else.\n",
      "Monica God works in mysterious ways.\n",
      "Chandler You have gotta stop!\n",
      "Monica But she liked us.\n",
      "Chandler She likes Doctor Chandler and Reverend Monica.\n",
      "Monica Well, if you think about it, I am kind of like a Reverend. I mean, as a chef, I serve God, by feeing the hungry and poor. (looks very convinced about what she just said)\n",
      "Chandler Your Veal Chop is $34,95!\n",
      "Monica C'mon Chandler, I think we have been given an opportunity. I mean, the mistake has already been made. They are writing up the paper right now.\n",
      "Chandler But we are not the one she chose! How can you feel okay about this?\n",
      "Monica (very emotional) Because... We may not be who she thinks we are but no-one will ever love that baby more than us.\n",
      "Chandler I know..\n",
      "Monica I mean, who knows how long it's gonna take for someone else to give us a baby? What if, what if no one ever picks us?\n",
      "Chandler oh, honey..\n",
      "Monica (Almost crying) Please.. please, we are so close.\n",
      "Chandler Monica, I want a baby too, but this woman is giving away her child. She deserves to know who it's going to.\n",
      "Monica (realizes Chandler is right. She's almost crying) okay, right. (They hug)\n",
      "Chandler So, we'll tell the truth and who knows, maybe she'll like us for us.\n",
      "Monica (sniffing) Maybe she will. Uh! Why couldn't I have been a Reverend?\n",
      "Chandler You're Jewish.\n",
      "Monica Technicality!\n",
      "Waiter A garden salad for the lady (sets the plate down)\n",
      "Joey Oh, that looks great! Good ordering!\n",
      "Waiter Seafood platter for the gentleman and extra fries. Enjoy!\n",
      "Sarah Mmmh, those fries look delicious.\n",
      "Joey oh, I didn't know you liked French fries. Help yourself! What's mine is yours. (Sarah reaches over and takes a few fries)\n",
      "Sarah (looks over at Joey's platter) Oh wow, are those stuffed clams?\n",
      "Joey Uuuh.. yes, they are my stuffed clams.\n",
      "Joey How about those fries though, huh? (Holds the plate between Sarah’s fingers and his plate, thus blocking her from reaching his)\n",
      "Sarah They are delicious (takes a few from the plate, puts one in her mouth and places the rest on her plate, then starts to reach over to Joey's platter again)\n",
      "Joey (Spotting her movements takes her hand into his own) You are beautiful, you know that?\n",
      "Sarah Oh, that is so sweet..\n",
      "Joey Oh (grinning, trying to hold in his impatience with her) okay.. (she takes her hand back)\n",
      "Joey (Visibly annoyed) NOW look what you did!!\n",
      "Sarah What? what is the matter with you?\n",
      "Joey I don't like it when people take food off of my plate, okay?\n",
      "Sarah But you just said \"What's mine is yours\"?\n",
      "Joey WELL, I DIDN'T MEAN IT!\n",
      "Sarah Fine, I'm sorry, I didn't think it was that big a deal.\n",
      "Joey I'm sorry, I'm overreacting. Okay, It's just when it comes to food, I have certain rules, okay, I mean (bends down and with his plate and his hands, scrapes the dropped dinner back onto the plate and puts it back on the table) There are things you do..and you now, things.. (takes something from the plate and blows it a little) that you don't do (He takes a bite from it).\n",
      "Girl Wow, this place looks great.\n",
      "Ross Oh! You are gonna love it! (The girl is looking in the other direction as Ross is taking off his own coat, revealing the pink and white ladies shirt) and I'm so glad, we're finally doing this.\n",
      "Girl Me too! (starts to take her coat off)\n",
      "Ross Here (gets behind her to help. When the coat comes off we see she is wearing the exact same shirt Ross is wearing. They look at each other, shocked. They abruptly put their coat back on) So this was fun! (They leave the room and head into opposite directions)\n",
      "Joey I really am sorry about, you know..before. I just want to make sure you know that I really do like you.\n",
      "Sarah Sure (smiling) Just not as much as clams.\n",
      "Joey (Jokingly) Well, stuffed clams.\n",
      "Waiter Chocolate Torte for the lady, cheesecake for the gentleman.\n",
      "Joey Uh, excuse me sir, there seems to be some sort of red crap on my cheesecake.\n",
      "Waiter Yes, that's Raspberry coule.\n",
      "Joey (More to himself than anyone else) So stupid, ordering cheesecake, trying to\n",
      "Sarah (tasting hers) Oh my God! (Looks at the waiter and then to Joey)\n",
      "Joey Oh, all right, I'll just have what she's having instead.\n",
      "Waiter Oh, I'm sorry sir, that was our last piece.\n",
      "Sarah Mmmm! Mmm!\n",
      "Sarah Oh, no! This is work. I should call in. Can you excuse me?\n",
      "Joey Oh yeah, sure. No problem.\n",
      "Sarah What are you doing? I thought you don't share food.\n",
      "Joey Sure I do. (holding up his own dessert) Coule?\n",

      "Adoption Agency guy Hey.\n",
      "Chandler Hey.\n",
      "Agency guy So, these are the preliminary forms for an open adoption. There's a lot to go over, but I'll explain everything as we go through it.\n",
      "Monica (pointing to a picture on the table) I-Is... Is that a picture?\n",
      "Erica Yeah. It's a sonogram they took of the baby last week. I thought you might want to see it. (gives it to Monica, who looks at it for a long time, and then shows it to Chandler)\n",
      "Monica Look, doctor!\n",
      "Agency guy I don't understand.\n",
      "Chandler The agency must have made some mistake. My wife is not a reverend and I'm not a doctor.\n",
      "Erica What?\n",
      "Agency guy That's impossible.\n",
      "Chandler I could perform an operation on you and prove it if you'd like.\n",
      "Agency guy I'll go check your file. Excuse me.\n",
      "Erica So who are you?\n",
      "Chandler Well, our names really are Monica and Chandler. We're from New York.\n",
      "Monica Yeah, but the important thing to know about us, is how much we would care for this little baby. (holds up the sonogram)\n",
      "Erica So you lied to me before?\n",
      "Monica Well, we... (makes quotation signs in the air) \"bore false witness\"... See I could be a reverend.\n",
      "Erica I can't believe this.\n",
      "Monica But we were hoping that since we told you the truth that you still might consider...\n",
      "Erica Giving you my baby? You think I'd give you my child after this?\n",
      "Monica Well, you don't have to decide right now, but if you could just look at our file...\n",
      "Erica I don't want to look at your file! This is over.\n",
      "Chandler Erica wait!\n",
      "Erica I've nothing to say to you. (walks a few paces)\n",
      "Chandler You have every reason to be upset. We did lie. But only because we've been waiting and trying to have a baby for so long. Now we don't know how long it's gonna be before we can get another chance again.\n",
      "Erica Why don't you ask the reverend to pray on it?\n",
      "Chandler Erica, please. Just consider us. Ask them to see our file. Our last name's Bing. My wife's a chef and I'm in advertising.\n",
      "Erica Oh yeah. I actually liked you guys. But it doesn't matter, because what you did was wrong. (walks away again, but Chandler catches up with her again)\n",
      "Chandler But you did like us. And you should. My wife's an incredible woman. She's loving and devoted and caring. And don't tell her I said this but the woman's always right... I love my wife more than anything in this world. And I... It kills me that I can't give her a baby... I really want a kid. And when that day finally comes, I'll learn how to be a good dad. But my wife... she's already there. She's a mother... without a baby... Please?\n",

      "Rachel Okay, that doesn’t help me, because we went to the same high school.\n",
      "Monica You went to one where you were popular, and you got to ride off Chip’s motorcycle, and wear his letterman jacket. I went to one where I wore a band uniform they had to have specially made.\n",

      "Ross So Pheebs, how long is your mom gonna be with us?\n",
      "Phoebe Well, I’m not sure. I mean, I guess until she y'know, gets used to the fact that there’s y'know, a new mom. Y'know, I think she’s worried that y'know, she’s gonna, she’s gonna be replaced. (to the cat, in a funny voice) Well, that’s not gonna happen is it? Noo. (gets up) Okay, I have to return a call in the other room.\n",
      "Monica Why can’t you use the phone in here?\n",
      "Phoebe Well, I’m returning a call from a certain mom at the B-E-A-C-H. I just spelled the wrong word. (goes into Monica’s room)\n",

      "Ross No you don’t.\n",
      "Rachel Yes, I do.\n",
      "Ross No you do—y'know what, you’re not gonna suck me into this.\n",

      "Rachel Jurassic Park could happen.\n",
      "Tony Wow! That’s ah, that’s pretty nice!\n",
      "Joey Pretty nice?\n",

      "Tony We don’t have 50 bucks, but would you be willing to trade for it? We’ve got a canoe.\n",
      "Chandler Y'know, I, I really don’t think we need a canoe.\n",
      "Tony You gotta take the canoe!\n",
      "Chandler All right, just, just take the entertainment center, and then when you get home, throw the canoe away!\n",
      "Peter We’re not throwing it away! I built that canoe! (starts to leave as Tony chases after him)\n",
      "Joey (to Peter) Good for you!!\n",
      "Rachel (entering) You guys, you’re never gonna believe what I just found tacked up on a telephone pole! (She’s holding a flyer.) Look kinda familiar?\n",
      "Ross (taking the flyer) Apparently Phoebe’s mother also goes by the name Julio.\n",
      "Rachel You guys, there’s a little girl in Soho looking for this cat. I mean, you know what that means?!\n",
      "Joey (looking at the flyer) Yeah-eah! 200 dollar reward, split five ways!!\n",
      "Rachel Do we have to tell her?\n",
      "Ross Yes, we have to tell her!\n",
      "Monica Oh, but it’s made her so happy.\n",
      "Ross (holds up a hand) Little girl misses her cat. (hold up the other hand) Crazy lady thinks her mother is in a cat. (gets up) Okay, y'know what, I have to go have dinner with my son, can I trust that when you see Phoebe, you will tell her.\n",
      "All (disappointed) Yeah.\n",
      "Ross Thank you.\n",
      "Rachel I hate when Ross is right!\n",

      "Rachel Hello, Chip.\n",
      "Chip Hey, Rach! How ya doin’?\n",
      "Rachel I’m great! I’m great. I’ve got a great job at Bloomingdale’s, have wonderful friends, and eventhough I’m not seeing anyone right now, I’ve never felt better about myself.\n",

      "Rachel She’ll be out in a second. So, Chip, how’s umm, Amy Welch?\n",
      "Chip Amy Welch? Wow! I haven’t seen her since... So, Monica about ready?\n",
      "Joey This is the unit for you my friend. Sturdy construction, tons of storage compartments, some big enough to fit a grown man.\n",
      "Guy What?!\n",
      "Joey Oh yeah! I got in there myself once. My roommate bet me five bucks that I couldn’t, and then he stuck a board through the handles that locked me in. Yeah. It was funny ‘til I started feeling like I was in a coffin.\n",
      "Guy No, you, you can’t fit in that thing. That’s not deep enough.\n",
      "Joey Oh yeah? (opens up the center and takes out the stereo) If I can’t, I’ll knock five bucks off the price off the unit.\n",
      "Guy All right, you have yourself a deal. (shakes his hand)\n",
      "Joey Okay. (he gets in the unit and closes the door) See?! I told ya!\n",
      "Joey Sometimes I get in here just to get away from it! Hey, a nickel!!\n",
      "Chip Here, we are.\n",
      "Monica Oh my God! You still have the Chipper!\n",
      "Chip The what?\n",
      "Monica That’s what we used to call your ah, your motorcycle in high school. Y'know how a motorcycle is a Chopper, and you’re Chip. Nevermind.\n",

      "Monica Wow! A lipper from Chipper.\n",
      "Chip So you still in touch with anyone from high school?\n",
      "Monica Umm. Well, there’s Rachel, and umm, I think that’s it. How bout you?\n",
      "Chip Oh yeah, I still hang with Simmons and Zana, y'know. I see Spindler a lot. Devane, Kelly, and I run into Goldie from time to time. Steve Brown, Zuchoff, McGwire, J.T., Breadsly.\n",
      "Monica Is that all?\n",
      "Chip Ehh, y'know after high school, you just kinda lose touch. Oh yeah! I ran into Richard Dorfman.\n",
      "Monica Ohh, how is he?\n",
      "Chip Not so good, Simmons and I gave him a wedgie.\n",
      "Monica Isn’t he an architect now?\n",

      "Joey (getting out) Awww, man! He promised he wouldn’t take the chairs!!\n",
      "Chandler What the hell happened?!! How were you locked in?!! And where the hell is all of our stuff?!!\n",
      "Joey Well, this guy came by to look at the unit and-and he said he didn’t think big enough to fit a grown man!\n",
      "Chandler So—You got in voluntarily?!\n",
      "Joey I was tryin’ to make a sale!! Oh, man, if I ever run into that guy again, do you know what I’m gonna do?\n",
      "Chandler BEND OVER?!!!\n",
      "Chip ...and then Zana, just let one rip!! (laughs histerically)\n",
      "Monica Look, not that I enjoy talking about people who I went to high school with, ‘cause I do, but umm, maybe we could talk about something else? Like you, I don’t even know where you work?\n",
      "Chip You know where I work!\n",
      "Monica I do?\n",
      "Chip The movie theatre, you used to come in all the time.\n",
      "Monica You still work at the multiplex?\n",
      "Chip Oh, like I’d give up that job! Free popcorn and candy, anytime I want. I can get you free posters for your room.\n",
      "Monica Thanks, I’m set. Do you still live with your parents?\n",
      "Chip Oh yeah, but I can stay out as late as I want.\n",

      "Rachel (to Monica) So, how was your date?\n",
      "Monica Well, y'know how I always wanted to go out with Chip Matthews in high school?\n",
      "Rachel Um-hmm.\n",
      "Monica Well, tonight, I actually went out with Chip Matthews in high school.\n",
      "Rachel Oh honey, I’m sorry.\n",
      "Monica No, it’s okay, not only did I get to go out with Chip Matthews, I got to dump Chip Matthews.\n",
      "Rachel Ohh! That’s so great!\n",
      "Monica I know!\n",
      "Ross (entering) Hey! So ah, what did the insurance company say?\n",
      "Chandler Oh, they said uh, “You don’t have insurance here, so stop calling us.”\n",
      "Ross (seeing Phoebe still with cat) You didn’t tell her?! (They all kinda shy away.) Okay, fine! Pheebs?\n",
      "Phoebe Yeah? (sees Ross) Hi!\n",
      "Ross Hi! Listen uhh, this cat belongs to a little girl. There are flyers all over the place.\n",
      "Rachel I’m sorry, sweetie. (shows her the flyer)\n",
      "Monica Hey, we can take her back with you if you want.\n",
      "Phoebe Ohh. Um-hmm. But y'know, she choose to find me. I mean, I have to respect her decision. Right?\n",
      "Chandler, Monica, Joey, and Rachel That’s a good call. Right.\n",
      "Ross No! No! Look—Hey, enough is enough! Look, I am sorry that you feel guilty or whatever about spending time with your new mom, but this is not your old mom. This is a cat! Okay, Julio the cat! Not mom! Cat!\n",
      "Phoebe (she turns around and puts the cat on the entertainment center) Ross, how many parents have you lost?\n",
      "Ross None.\n",
      "Phoebe Okay, then you don’t know what it feels like when one of them comes back. Do you? I believe this is my Mother. Even if I’m wrong, who cares? Just be a friend. Okay? Be supportive.\n",
      "Ross I’m sorry.\n",
      "Phoebe Okay.\n",
      "Ross I don’t know what to say.\n",
      "Rachel You could.... say you’re sorry to her mom.\n",
      "Phoebe I think she would like that.\n",
      "Ross (goes over to Julio) Come here, here, come here, come here, (pause) Mrs. Buffay. Sorry, about what I said, umm, it was, it was insensitive of me to say that you were just a cat. When clearly you are also the reincarnated spirit, of my friend’s mother.\n",
      "Phoebe Thank you. We both forgive you.\n",
      "Rachel So honey, what are you gonna do about the little girl?\n",
      "Phoebe Yeah, okay, listen, umm, Mom, I hope you know you still mean a lot to me. And you’re welcome to come back anytime.\n",
      "Chandler Pheebs, if she could come back as a couch, we’d really appreciate it. (Joey nods in agreement)\n",

      "Estelle Joey! It’s Estelle! Great news, I was able to get you and one guest tickets to your premiere.\n",
      "Joey One guest? You told me I can have six tickets!\n",
      "Estelle Well, I sold four of them on Ebay. You’ll be sitting next to HotGuy372.\n",
      "Joey Oh my God. So that’s it?! I only get to bring one guest?\n",
      "Estelle Yeah, what time do you wanna pick me up? (Joey hangs up on her.) Hello?\n",
      "Joey (to Monica, Chandler, and Phoebe) Did you hear that? I only get one extra ticket to my premiere. So some how I have to pick between you three and Ross.\n",
      "Rachel (overhearing that) What-what about me?\n",
      "Joey You said you didn’t want to go.\n",
      "Rachel I don’t. But I would still like to be acknowledged. What? Just because I’m pregnant you think I’m invisible.\n",
      "Joey Definitely not invisible.\n",
      "Monica Well, well Ross didn’t care enough to be here, so I think he’s out. You snooze you lose.\n",
      "Chandler He’s not snoozing, he’s teaching a class.\n",
      "Monica Well then somebody’s snoozing. Joey, not that this uh should affect you at all, but if you were to pick me, I was planning on wearing a sequined dress, cut down to here. (Points to her stomach just above her belly button.)\n",
      "Chandler I haven’t seen this dress.\n",
      "Monica Star in a movie.\n",
      "Phoebe Joey, you pick who ever you want. Okay? You just listen to your heart. What does it tell you? (Mimicking a heartbeat and tapping her chest.) Phoebe, Phoebe.\n",
      "Joey Well uh…I think I want to take Chandler.\n",
      "Phoebe (still mimicking a heartbeat, only faster) Phoebe-Phoebe-Phoebe-Phoebe—Burrrrr! (Mimics the sound of a cardiac monitor going off.)\n",
      "Chandler You really want to take me?\n",
      "Joey Yeah! Yeah! I mean I’m sorry, I wish I can take everybody, but y’know Chandler always supported my career. He’s paid for acting classes and head shots and stuff and well this will be my way of paying you back.\n",
      "Chandler So you’re never actually going to pay me back?\n",
      "Monica Wait a minute, just because he paid for your head shots you’re gonna take him? Joey, I don’t think you’re comprehending just how slutty this dress is!\n",
      "Joey It’s not just the stuff he paid for, I mean it’s-it’s everything. Y’know? He read lines with me. He-he went with me on auditions when I was really nervous, and then he consoled me after I didn’t get parts that I really wanted. You always believed in me man. Even, even when I didn’t believe in myself.\n",
      "Chandler I always knew you were gonna make it. I’m so proud of you.\n",
      "Joey Thanks. That means a lot to me.\n",
      "Phoebe Mon, maybe one of these guys wants to wear your dress.\n",
      "Joey (in a manly voice) I’m gonna go shave. (Gets up.)\n",
      "Chandler (in a manly voice) Yeah well, I’m gonna go spit. (He goes into the bedroom. On his way out, Joey gives Rachel a wide berth.)\n",
      "Rachel Oh, I have to pee. If I don’t come out in five minutes it’s because I’ve choked to death on the potpourri stink. (Goes into the bathroom.)\n",
      "Phoebe When she comes out, you hold her nose, I’ll blow in her mouth, and the kid will just (makes a popping sound) right out of her.\n",
      "Monica She’s over a week late! She gotta have it today, right?\n",
      "Phoebe I don’t know. I-I think it’s still gonna be a while.\n",
      "Monica Hmm, care to make it interesting? I’ll bet you that she’ll have it by this time tomorrow.\n",
      "Phoebe You’re on!\n",
      "Monica Okay, how much?\n",
      "Phoebe One hundred thousand dollars!\n",
      "Monica How about fifty bucks?\n",
      "Phoebe Fine! I’ll call Zurich and move some money around.\n",
      "Rachel (calling from the bathroom) All right, who’s turn is it to help me get up!\n",
      "Phoebe No one’s here! (Monica looks at her.) Oh damnit!\n",
      "Chandler This is so exciting! It’s so glamorous! People taking our picture. How do I look?\n",
      "Joey A little tall.\n",
      "Chandler What?\n",
      "Joey Do you mind crouching down a little bit, so that I look taller? (Chandler does so) There you go. (And they walk down the red carpet.)\n",
      "Chandler It’s just so glamorous.\n",
      "Phoebe Oh hey Mon? Rach is here! Ohh, you’re still pregnant. Oh, I’m sorry. I know how uncomfortable you are. Y’know what? You look great. Yeah, like fifty bucks.\n",
      "Rachel Oh, I have to go pee. Apparently this baby thinks that my bladder is a squeeze toy. (Goes to the bathroom.)\n",
      "Monica Damnit! Damnit!! Here’s your fifty bucks! (Pays Phoebe.)\n",
      "Phoebe It’s interesting that you lost. Now, I forget, do you like to lose?\n",
      "Monica Now stop it! Double or nothing that she has it by tomorrow!\n",
      "Phoebe Fine! You’re on!\n",
      "Monica Okay.\n",
      "Phoebe Until then, General Grant, why don’t you set up camp (She puts the bill in her bra) right there.\n",
      "Ross (entering) Hey is Rachel here? We have a doctor’s appointment.\n",
      "Monica She’s in the bathroom.\n",
      "Ross Rach, we gotta go.\n",
      "Rachel In a minute!!!\n",
      "Ross People ask me why we’re not together, I just don’t know what to tell them.\n",
      "Rachel (entering) All right, all right. Let’s go!\n",
      "Ross Uh, do you wanna go change first? The doctor’s keeping the office open late for us, but if you hurry…\n",
      "Rachel No, I’m fine.\n",
      "Ross Really? You don’t think that’s a little inappropriate. (She’s wearing a tank top and has her belly sticking out.)\n",
      "Phoebe Good God man don’t anger it.\n",
      "Rachel Ross, it is 100 degrees outside. For the first time in weeks, I am somewhat comfortable.\n",
      "Ross Fine! Fine! Y’know what? Whatever you want. Okay? You’re the mommy.\n",
      "Rachel Oh uh-uh pal! Don’t call me mommy! It’s bad enough you call your own mother that. (He looks at Monica.)\n",
      "Monica I’m actually with her on this one.\n",
      "Joey (onscreen) \"I thought I knew who the enemy was, but it was you all along.\"\n",
      "Joey (To Chandler) Okay, this is it. It’s my big fight scene coming up. (He looks over and Chandler and notices that he’s asleep.)\n",
      "Rachel Ross.\n",
      "Ross Yeah?\n",
      "Rachel Can I ask you something?\n",
      "Ross Uh-huh.\n",
      "Rachel When Carol was pregnant with Ben…\n",
      "Ross Mmm?\n",
      "Rachel …were you this irritating?\n",
      "Ross Wow!\n",
      "Rachel Excuse me?!\n",
      "Ross Oh nothing. Nothing! Just uh, you’ve been a little short with me lately. I’m not trying to irritate you.\n",
      "Rachel Well then you just must have a natural talent for it.\n",
      "Ross Y’know what? The doctor will be in soon, why don’t we not speak until then.\n",
      "Rachel (silently) Okay. (Pause) Seriously, breathe louder Ross! That’s great!\n",
      "Ross Y’know we should probably ask the doctor if she even knows how to deliver a baby that’s half human and half pure evil!\n",
      "Rachel Hi Dr. Long, how are you?\n",
      "Ross (to Rachel) Oh, you’re nice to her.\n",
      "Rachel She has the drugs!\n",
      "Dr. Long We’ll do a quick check.\n",
      "Rachel Okay. (Rachel lies back.)\n",
      "Dr. Long So, eight days late huh?\n",
      "Rachel Yeah.\n",
      "Dr. Long You must be a little uncomfortable.\n",
      "Rachel Eh, just a tad.\n",
      "Dr. Long You’re about 80 percent effaced, so you’re on your way. It still could last a little while longer. If you’re anxious there are a few ways to help things along.\n",
      "Ross Do them!!\n",
      "Dr. Long Actually, they’re things you can do. Just some home remedies, but in my experience I’ve found that some of them are quite effective.\n",
      "Rachel Well, we are ready to try anything.\n",
      "Dr. Long Okay, there’s an herbal tea you can drink.\n",
      "Rachel Okay.\n",
      "Dr. Long You can take some caster oil, there’s eating spicy foods…\n",
      "Rachel Great! We will do all of those.\n",
      "Dr. Long …taking a long walk, and then there’s the one that’s proved most effective: sex.\n",
      "Ross You’ve got to be kidding me!\n",
      "Chandler Good job Joe! Well done! Top notch!\n",
      "Joey You liked it? You really liked it?\n",
      "Chandler Oh-ho-ho, yeah!\n",
      "Joey Which part exactly?\n",
      "Chandler The whole thing! Can we go?\n",
      "Joey Oh no-no-no, give me some specifics.\n",
      "Chandler I love the specifics, the specifics were the best part!\n",
      "Joey Hey, what about the scene with the kangaroo? Did-did you like that part?\n",
      "Chandler I was surprised to see a kangaroo in a World War I epic.\n",
      "Joey You fell asleep!! There was no kangaroo! They didn’t take any of my suggestions! That’s for coming buddy. I’ll see you later. (Starts to walk out.)\n",
      "Chandler Don’t go! I’m sorry. I’m so sorry! (Sees another guy who is still asleep.) Look! This guy fell asleep! He fell asleep too! Be mad at him! (Looks at him more closely.) Or, call an ambulance.\n",
      "Monica Hey!\n",
      "Ross Hey.\n",
      "Rachel Hi!\n",
      "Monica What did the doctor say? Any news on when the baby will come?\n",
      "Rachel No. But she did give us some ideas on how to induce labor.\n",
      "Ross Yeah, we tried them all. We went for a walk, uh we tried a special tea, caster oil, spicy food nothing has worked.\n",
      "Rachel Well, there is one thing that we haven’t tried, but someone thinks that, (mimicking Ross) \"That will open up a can of worms.\"\n",
      "Monica Well what is it? What is it? If it’s gonna help bring the baby here, like today. I mean, I think you should do it.\n",
      "Ross It’s sex.\n",
      "Monica Do it!\n",
      "Ross Monica!\n",
      "Monica I’m just saying it’s been a really long time for you. I mean, women have needs. Do it, get yours!\n",
      "Phoebe Oh I-I don’t know about that. No, I think that if the two of you had sex the-the-the repercussions would be catastrophic.\n",
      "Monica All right, let’s be practical, if Ross isn’t willing to do it, he’s not the only guy in the world you can have sex with. You can borrow Chandler—Chandler is good!\n",
      "Ross Monica, what is the matter with you?\n",
      "Monica Nothing. I just want the baby to be born today.\n",
      "Rachel Why? Why today?\n",
      "Monica Okay fine! I keep betting Phoebe that you’re gonna have the baby and I don’t want to lose again!\n",
      "Ross What?! While she’s been going through this hell, you’ve been making money?! You’re betting on your friend staying in this misery?! (Phoebe lowers her head and shakes it yes.)\n",
      "Rachel I’ll take that bet.\n",
      "Ross What?!\n",
      "Rachel Well, I’m miserable here! I might as well make some money out it!\n",
      "Ross Can I get some of that action?\n",
      "Monica Wait a minute! Now I’m betting against all three of you?\n",
      "Rachel Oh honey, don’t worry. I really do feel like tomorrow’s the day.\n",
      "Monica Oh, okay!\n",
      "Joey Hey! Sleeping beauty!\n",
      "Chandler Where have you been?! I tried to call you! I want to talk to you! I still feel so bad!\n",
      "Joey (in a baby voice) Oh no, were you upset? Did you lose sleep?\n",
      "Chandler I’m so sorry.\n",
      "Joey Uh-huh look, the only reason I can over here was to settle things between us! Okay? You’ve done a lot for me and my career, I wanted to pay you back so I took you to the premiere but you missed it! Okay, so how much do I owe you?\n",
      "Chandler What?!\n",
      "Joey Give me a number, I don’t want to owe you anything!\n",
      "Chandler You don’t owe me anything, I don’t want you money…\n",
      "Joey Ah-ah-ah! We’re doing this! Okay, now you got me my first set of head shots. Right, how much were those?\n",
      "Chandler I don’t know, five hundred dollars?\n",
      "Joey Okay, five hundred dollars. What else?\n",
      "Chandler Well then there was the second set, the infamous booger head shots.\n",
      "Joey Okay, so that’s another five hundred. Five hundred and five hundred, that’s… (Pauses to figure it out.)\n",
      "Chandler Do you want a calculator?\n",
      "Joey Please!\n",
      "Chandler Here! (Hands him one. Joey adds it up and discovers that he was right.)\n",
      "Joey All right, what else?\n",
      "Chandler Well uh, there was acting classes, stage combat classes, tap classes…\n",
      "Joey Which we’re still keeping under our hats!\n",
      "Chandler Uh then there was that dialect coach who helped you with that play where you needed a southern accent. Which after twenty hours of lessons still came out Jamaican.\n",
      "Joey What the hell are you talking about, (in a Jamaican accent) \"The south will rise again man.\"\n",
      "Chandler Yes, money well spent!\n",
      "Joey Yeah. Okay, what else? Rent!\n",
      "Chandler Okay, two, three years of rent, utilities, food…\n",
      "Joey Okay. Okay, so I’m writing you a check for…So you fell asleep during my movie. Big deal right? How do you clear this thing?\n",
      "Ross Come on, finish your enchilada.\n",
      "Rachel Ross I—We tried all the spicy food. It’s not working.\n",
      "Ross Okay here, have one of these peppers. Oh ha… Oh God! So…so hot! (Rubs his eyes.) Oh my—(Laughs.) By the way, you don’t want to touch the pepper and then touch your eye.\n",
      "Rachel I am feeling nothing. Speaking of hot, watching you do that really makes me want to have sex with you.\n",
      "Ross Stop it.\n",
      "Rachel Oh come on Ross, why are we wasting our time with this other stuff?! We know what’s gonna work! It’s doctor recommended!\n",
      "Ross I’m sorry, but we have to have some boundaries! My God, I’m dying.\n",
      "Rachel Oh come on Ross, we’ve done it before we’ll do it again, it’ll be a nice way to bookend the pregnancy.\n",
      "Ross This is insane, I’m not gonna make love to you just so that you’ll go into labor.\n",
      "Rachel Make love? What are you a girl?\n",
      "Ross Always a great way to get in a man’s pants.\n",
      "Rachel But you will, you will be performing a service. Okay? Just-just think of me as a ketchup bottle, y’know you sometimes you have to bang on the end of it just to get something to come out.\n",
      "Ross I love when you talk dirty to me.\n",
      "Rachel Oh, I know it. You’re right. That’s not sexy. Oh…Oh! (Drops a fork on the floor.) Whoops! Oh, I seem to have dropped my fork. Let me just bed over and get it. (Tries too, but can’t quite seem to make it.) Oh God!\n",
      "Ross Okay enough! This is, this is not going to happen.\n",
      "Rachel Come on Ross! I’m miserable here! Come on! You started this, now you finish it! Come on wuss, make love to me.\n",
      "Ross Y’know what?\n",
      "Rachel What?!\n",
      "Ross Forget it.\n",
      "Rachel Oh wow! What now Ross you’re not gonna talk? How on earth will you ever annoy me? Oh wait a minute, I know. (Mimics his breathing.) I mean you’d think the damn jalepeno would’ve cleared up your sinuses, but no!! That’s not enough… (Ross jumps over and kisses her.) What are you doing?!\n",
      "Ross I’m getting that baby out of you!\n",
      "Rachel (breaking the kiss) Oh God!\n",
      "Ross Oh, I know.\n",
      "Rachel Oh no. No-no! I think my water just broke.\n",
      "Ross I am good. Okay! Okay! Uh, I got the pillow! I got the bag! You got the keys?\n",
      "Rachel Okay! I got the keys! Okay! Okay!\n",
      "Ross Hey!\n",
      "Rachel Yeah.\n",
      "Ross We’re having a baby.\n",
      "Rachel I didn’t uh, really have time to read this part of the books, but do you think we have time to…\n",
      "Ross Not so much.\n",
      "Rachel Okay.\n",
      "Monica Two hundred.\n",
      "Phoebe Thank you!\n",
      "Monica That’s it. I’m done. I don’t care when the baby comes, no more betting.\n",
      "Phoebe Okay.\n",
      "Monica Hello? (Listens) Uh-huh. (Listens) Uh-huh. (Listens) Okay. (Hangs up.) I guess we can bet one more time.\n",
      "Phoebe Is Rachel having the baby?\n",
      "Monica How did you know that?! (Runs to yell at Joey’s apartment.) Joey! Chandler!! It’s time!\n",
      "Phoebe They’re at the coffeehouse.\n",
      "Monica You know everything!! Oh wait, double or nothing. I bet you the baby is over seven pounds. (Phoebe isn’t interested.) I bet you it has hair. (She’s still not interested.) I bet you it’s a girl.\n",
      "Phoebe We know it’s a girl! (Exits.)\n",
      "Monica (following her) I’ll give you really good odds.\n",

      "Monica No reason. I-I keep private things in there.\n",

      "Ross What?! It is?! (He tries to quickly remove his gloves, but runs into trouble and finally throws them off of his hands like a hockey player in a fight and grabs Rachel’s belly.)\n",
      "Rachel It’s not kicking right now. Although we would love to see you do (Mimics him) that again.\n",
      "Ross Hey, when-when was it kicking? What happened?\n",
      "Rachel Last night! I just felt it and I went into Joey’s room and he was sleeping…\n",
      "Joey A dreamless sleep.\n",
      "Ross My God, the baby’s kicking. That’s great. Although I…kinda wish I-I would’ve been there to feel the kicking for the first time y’know.\n",
      "Joey Well I got stuff going on in here (Rubbing his belly) if you wanna feel.\n",
      "Ross Look, I-I don’t want to miss anymore baby stuff. So…Here. Here’s my new pager number, okay? Anytime anything pregnancy related happens use it! I’ll be there! Okay? I don’t care if it’s three in the morning and all you want is ice cream.\n",
      "Joey Wow! Can I get a copy of that?\n",
      "Phoebe (calling from her room) Are you under the sheet?\n",
      "Monica Yes.\n",
      "Phoebe (in a soothing voice) Great, let’s begin. (She starts the massage.) How’s the pressure?\n",
      "Monica Nice! Wow Phoebe you are good!\n",
      "Phoebe Stating the obvious, but thank you. And it’s not weird is it.\n",
      "Monica No. Ooohh…\n",
      "Phoebe That’s right, you just enjoy.\n",
      "Monica (in a sexy voice) Oh. Oh yeah! Ohhhhh! Ohh! Oh yeah!\n",
      "Phoebe (getting uncomfortable) Okay.\n",
      "Monica Oh God Phoebe!! (Phoebe covers one ear.) Oh that’s it! That’s it! Right there! Oh! (Tries to cover the other ear.) Ooooh-oooh-ooooh… (Covers both ears and continues the massage with her elbows.)\n",
      "Chandler I wasn’t trying to open your closet! I wasn’t trying to open your closet! I swear! (Running into the kitchen and sees its Joey.)\n",
      "Joey Whoa, Monica runs a pretty tight ship over here. What are you doing?\n",
      "Chandler Monica has a secret closet and she won’t let me see what’s in it.\n",
      "Joey Why not?\n",
      "Chandler I don’t know! What could she possibly be hiding in here that I can’t see?!\n",
      "Joey I don’t know. Ooh, I bet it’s Richard.\n",
      "Chandler Why would Monica be keeping Richard in here?\n",
      "Joey Well off the top of my head uhh, maybe she’s having her cake and eating it too. You being the cake and Richard being the too. Or!\n",
      "Chandler And here we go…\n",
      "Joey I saw this movie once where there was a door and no one knew what was behind it, and when they finally got it open millions and millions and millions of bugs came pouring out and they feasted on human flesh. Y’know it wouldn’t kill ya to respect your wife’s privacy! (He walks away and into his apartment and looks the door.) Stupid closet full of bugs!\n",
      "Rachel Joey. Joey, something feels weird and not good weird. I don’t—Whoa!! (Winces in pain.)\n",
      "Joey Oh hey whoa-whoa, don’t worry. Okay. When my sisters were pregnant they got every weird feeling in the book, it was always nothing.\n",
      "Rachel Really?\n",
      "Joey Absolutely. But, we’re gonna stop by the hospital just to be sure, okay? I’ll page Ross on the way. Come on.\n",
      "Rachel Okay. Oh God—Ow!—Oo!\n",
      "Joey Okay Rach-Rach-Rach look at me, look at me, everything’s gonna be fine, trust me. Okay. Take my hand. Here we go. (Rachel grabs his hand.) Oww crushing bones!\n",
      "Joey Hey! So?\n",
      "Dr. Long She’s fine. She’s experiencing Braxton-Hicks contractions, mild discomfort caused by contractions in the uterine wall.\n",
      "Rachel Hmm, mild discomfort. So I take it you’ve had one of these Braxton thingies?\n",
      "Joey So but everything is normal.\n",
      "Dr. Long Absolutely.\n",
      "Joey And-and there’s no danger to her and the baby?\n",
      "Dr. Long No-no. Contractions can be unnerving if you don’t know what they are, but she’s fine.\n",
      "Rachel Thank you doctor. (Dr. Long exits.) (To Joey) Oh thank you for being so nice and calm.\n",
      "Joey Calm?! I wasn’t calm! I’ve never been more scared in all my life!\n",
      "Rachel But wait you said everything was gonna be okay.\n",
      "Joey Well what do I know?! I’m not a doctor!\n",
      "Rachel But I—But everything is okay. I’m fine!\n",
      "Joey You sure?!\n",
      "Rachel Yes! Yes! I got half a mind to contract that doctor’s uterus though. Mild discomfort, what’s he talking about?\n",
      "Joey (seeing Ross) Oh hey-hey!\n",
      "Ross (rushes in) Is everything okay?\n",
      "Rachel Yeah, everything’s fine!\n",
      "Ross Your page said come to the hospital, what? What was it? What happened?\n",
      "Joey Something called Braxton-Hicks contractions.\n",
      "Ross Oh. Oh. Thank God, most women don’t even feel them.\n",
      "Rachel Okay, no uterus, no opinion.\n",
      "Joey Hey uh, what’s with the candy?\n",
      "Ross Oh when you beeped me I was on line at the concession stand at the movie theater.\n",
      "Rachel Oh you went to the movies by yourself?\n",
      "Ross No I—Mona!\n",
      "Rachel Oh, I gotta go back in there.\n",
      "Ross What? Why? What’s wrong?\n",
      "Rachel No, everything’s fine. I just gotta go back…\n",
      "Ross No really, you tell me what’s up.\n",
      "Rachel I-I forgot my underwear. (Ross lets her go.)\n",
      "Ross (To Joey) So, thanks so much for bringing her to the hospital.\n",
      "Joey Oh hey, don’t worry about it man. Don’t worry about it, no big deal.\n",
      "Ross Yeah but still, I mean it should’ve been me. I’m the dad.\n",
      "Dr. Long (To Joey) Uh, if you have any questions, here’s some information on Braxton-Hicks. (Hands Joey a pamphlet.) Oh and by the way, you did the right thing by bringing her in. You’re gonna make a wonderful father.\n",
      "Joey Oh uh, hey. Not as good as this guy! (Grabs Ross around the shoulders.) He brought Twizlers!\n",
      "Chandler There has got to be a way!\n",
      "Joey Easy there Captain Kirk. Oh, do you have a bobby pin?\n",
      "Chandler Yeah. (Checks his hair.) Oh no wait, I’m not an nine-year-old girl.\n",
      "Joey Then why do you throw like one?\n",
      "Chandler Maybe Monica has a bobby pin.\n",
      "Joey Sure. \"Monica.\"\n",
      "Chandler So, how’s the hideously inappropriate crush on Rachel coming?\n",
      "Joey Uh, really good. Really good. Yeah, I should be ready to kill myself any day now. (Chandler returns with a bobby pin and hands it to Joey.) Wow, you sure found that quick. (He tries the pin in the lock.) I just—I wish I didn’t feel this way about Rachel anymore, y’know? I wish things could go back to normal. I mean, I love living with her and God, helping out with the baby is just amazing, but now I think…I think Ross feels left out. Y’know? When I had to take Rachel to the hospital, the doctor thought I was the father. God… You should’ve seen the look on Ross’s face. (Pause) By the way, I have no idea what I’m doing here. For all I know I’m just locking it more. Oh hey, did you try opening it with a credit card?\n",
      "Chandler That’s a good idea.\n",
      "Joey Yeah.\n",
      "Chandler Okay. (They switch places and Chandler gets out a credit card.) So uh, Ross is kinda bummed huh?\n",
      "Joey Oh, I just…I feel terrible.\n",
      "Chandler Well, it’s not your fault. What are you gonna do? Not take her to the hospital? Y’know? You’re doing nothing wrong. (Pause) Except for harboring an all consuming love for the woman whose carrying his baby. (He loses his card behind the door.) Richard? If-if you’re in there, could you pass me my credit card?\n",
      "Monica Hey.\n",
      "Phoebe Hey.\n",
      "Monica I gotta tell you, yesterday was amazing. That massage felt so good!\n",
      "Phoebe No-no, I got that.\n",
      "Monica So umm, what do you say we make it a weekly appointment?\n",
      "Phoebe Okay. Okay but you should know though, I’ve raised my rates to $200 an hour.\n",
      "Monica Okay.\n",
      "Phoebe I mean $500.\n",
      "Monica What?\n",
      "Phoebe 600.\n",
      "Monica What’s going on?\n",
      "Phoebe Oh, you make sex noises when you get massaged!\n",
      "Monica What? (Laughs.)\n",
      "Phoebe Yeah, and it really freaked me out! And after a while I even tried to hurt you and it just spurred you on.\n",
      "Monica What?! You’re crazy! There’s nothing sexual about the noises I make!\n",
      "Phoebe Really? There’s nothing sexual about this? (Sexily) Oooh. Oo God! Ohh. Ohhhh. Ohh. (Some cute guy is watching closely.) (To him) What are you looking at?! (Pause) I mean hi.\n",
      "Monica Oh my—This is so embarrassing. Oh my God, I’m never gonna get massaged again!\n",
      "Phoebe No, you can’t let this stop you from getting massages! No look, I have, I have lots of clients that make the same noises you do!\n",
      "Monica Really?!\n",
      "Phoebe Well not clients, lovers. But let’s just y’know, try it again. Come back and-and we’ll work through it.\n",
      "Monica Are you sure?\n",
      "Phoebe Yes.\n",
      "Monica I guess.\n",
      "Phoebe Great! Okay, if you’ll just excuse me. (To the guy) So, did you hear something you liked?\n",
      "Rachel Hey Ross! Check it out! I learned a new trick!\n",
      "Ross Hey uh, I brought you some lunch.\n",
      "Rachel Ohh! That’s so sweet of you! Oh yum! (Takes a bite out of the sandwich and starts to get sick.) Did you put pickles on this?\n",
      "Ross Well yeah!\n",
      "Rachel Oh Ross!! (Runs to the bathroom and closes the door.)\n",
      "Ross What?! What?! Rach what?!\n",
      "Joey What’s going on?\n",
      "Ross I made her favorite, tuna salad with pickles.\n",
      "Joey Pickle? Pickles make her sick. Giving her pickles is like giving me salad.\n",
      "Ross (to Rachel) I-I’m sorry Rach, I didn’t know. Are you gonna be okay?\n",
      "Rachel Yeah, I’ll be fine. But could someone please make sure that sandwich is gone when I get out there?\n",
      "Joey I’m on it! (Takes a bite out of the sandwich.)\n",
      "Ross I can’t believe this! I shouldn’t be the one making her throw up!\n",
      "Joey Dude relax! It could happen to anyone.\n",
      "Ross Yeah? Not to you, because you know this stuff. I don’t know any of it and I’m the father. I wish I’d be more involved y’know.\n",
      "Rachel (entering) Well, if anyone is keeping score, I no longer eat tuna.\n",
      "Joey Hey uh, can I, can I talk to you guys for a second?\n",
      "Ross Yeah.\n",
      "Rachel What’s up?\n",
      "Joey Uh, sit down. I wanna talk about our situation.\n",
      "Rachel (Gasps) Are you breaking up with us?\n",
      "Joey The thing is…’cause I live with Rachel I’m here for a lot of the stuff, okay? (To Rachel) And Ross…Ross is missing everything. So…\n",
      "Rachel Yeah?\n",
      "Joey Maybe you two should live together.\n",
      "Rachel Are you asking me to move out? Do you not want me here?\n",
      "Joey Oh no-no, no-no I love living with you. It just seems that…if you’re gonna have a roommate, y’know it might as well be the father.\n",
      "Rachel But Joey, I don’t think Ross wants me to move into his apartment and disrupt his life like that. I mean—(Ross turns to her with wishful eyes.)—Or he does.\n",
      "Ross No I-I-I would love to be around for you and the baby. And we-we can just try it like on a temporary basis.\n",
      "Rachel But Ross, its you and me!\n",
      "Ross So? Sure! But it-it wouldn’t be anything romantic. And I’m-I’m dating Mona—Damnit Mona! I was supposed to meet her like an hour ago! What is wrong with me?!\n",
      "Joey All right now, so? What do you think?\n",
      "Rachel I don’t know. Is it crazy?\n",
      "Ross No! No it’s not. Joey, this is a smart idea.\n",
      "Joey Well, I was due.\n",
      "Rachel Okay, let’s do it. I’ll move in.\n",
      "Ross Really?\n",
      "Rachel Yeah.\n",
      "Ross Oh Rach that’s great. That’s great. (They hug and Joey breathes a sigh of relief.)\n",
      "Chandler Not to shabby, I got this all off myself…using my wife’s tools. (He takes the door off the frame and we finally get to see what’s behind the green door! It is stacked, floor to ceiling, with junk.) Oh my God!\n",
      "Monica (entering) (Gasps) How did you get in there?!\n",
      "Chandler (laughs) You’re messy.\n",
      "Monica Oh no! You weren’t supposed to see this!\n",
      "Chandler I married Fred Sanford!\n",
      "Monica No Chandler, you don’t understand! (Chandler starts singing the theme for Sanford and Son, an old TV show starring Redd Fox.) Okay! Okay! Okay! Fine! Now you know. Okay? I’m y’know…I’m sick.\n",
      "Chandler No, honey you’re not sick! Look, I don’t love you because you’re organized, I love you in spite of that.\n",
      "Monica Really? You promise you won’t tell anyone?\n",
      "Chandler Yes! And look, now that I know if I got some extra stuff lying around can we, can we share the closet.\n",
      "Monica Well…it’s just umm…I’m afraid you might mess it up.\n",
      "Chandler Hey.\n",
      "Joey Hey.\n",
      "Chandler So Rachel’s all moved out huh? How are you taking it?\n",
      "Joey Well uh, I wanted to have a few beers, but uh, I got rid of those because Rachel couldn’t stand the smell of them. But I have thrown back a lot of orange juice with calcium though. And uh, it’s a couple weeks past it’s expiration date, so it’s got a bit of a kick.\n",
      "Chandler Are you okay?\n",
      "Joey Are you kidding me? I’m great! Yeah, I’m uh; I’m better than great. I am good. And now that she’s gone, I can uh, I can do all this stuff around here that I couldn’t do before. Y’know? Like umm, I can walk around naked again. Y’know? I can uh, I can watch porn in the living room. Right? This is uh, this is good for me. Y’know? I like being on my own, I’m uh, better off this way. I’m uh, a lone wolf. Y’know? A loner. Alone. All alone. Forever. What’s a wolf got to do to get a huh around here?! (Chandler rushes over and hugs him.)\n",
      "Monica Ohhh.\n",
      "Phoebe That’s it. Just relax.\n",
      "Monica Ohh. Oh! Ohh!\n",
      "Phoebe Come on more!\n",
      "Monica Oh God!\n",
      "Phoebe Yeah, you like that don’t you?\n",
      "Monica Oh yeah right there!\n",
      "Phoebe You want it there? You take it there baby!\n",
      "Monica Uh Phoebe?\n",
      "Phoebe Yeah, say my name. Say it! (She stops when she realizes what she’s doing.) And now I’m going to cover you back up, and umm we’re never doing this again.\n",

      "Joey I was just outside Barcelona hiking in the foothills of Mount Tibidabo. I was at the end of this path and I came to a clearing and there was a lake, very secluded. And there were tall trees all around. (Whispering) It was dead silent. Gorgeous. (Softly) And across the lake I saw…a beautiful woman…bathing herself…but she was crying…\n",
      "Ross (intently listening) Why?\n",
      "Kristen Umm, this is great wine.\n",
      "Ross It’s from France…In Europe…Western Europe. Y’know umm, a few years ago I actually was backpacking across Western Europe.\n",
      "Kristen Really?\n",
      "Ross Uh-hmm—Wait! It gets better. Um, yeah I was in Barcelona.\n",
      "Kristen I studied for a year in Barcelona. (Ross is stunned and worried.)\n",
      "Ross Anyway, umm so I was um, I was hiking…\n",
      "Kristen I love hiking!\n",
      "Ross (whines) Oh that’s great! I was hiking along the foothills of Mount Tibidaybo…\n",
      "Kristen I think its Tibidabo.\n",
      "Ross Okay! Do you wanna tell the story?!\n",
      "Joey Whoa! What are you doing here? How did your date go?\n",
      "Ross Great! I’m across the street having sex with her right now. Your story sucks!\n",
      "Joey Hey! Look, if it didn’t work it’s because you didn’t tell it right! Show me how you did it.\n",
      "Ross No! No, I don’t…don’t want to.\n",
      "Joey How long since you’ve seen a girl naked?\n",
      "Ross I was backpacking across Western Europe.\n",
      "Joey I’m not feeling it.\n",
      "Ross I was just outside Barcelona, hiking…\n",
      "Joey No! No! No Ross! I’m not hot! Are you hot?\n",
      "Ross It’s been six months! I’m always hot!\n",
      "Joey Well you’re not selling the story! It’s like; it’s like you don’t believe it! Look, I gotta go. I got a date, but try this. Do what I do when I’m preparing for an audition. Okay? I’ll set you up with my video camera and you can record yourself and-and see what you’re doing wrong.\n",
      "Ross I’ll try that.\n",
      "Joey All right now… All right, you’re all set up. You’re good to go. Just hit record. All right?\n",
      "Ross Thanks.\n",
      "Joey Good luck.\n",
      "Ross Thanks. And-and hey Joe?\n",
      "Joey Yeah?\n",
      "Ross Listen, if you ever have any problem with the ladies you know I’ll help you out.\n",
      "Joey (trying not to laugh) That means a lot to me man. (Exits.)\n",
      "Ross Hello! Can I get you anything? Huh? Lens cleaner? Your battery okay? (Rachel bursts in carrying two boxes and Ross jumps up.) Rachel!\n",
      "Rachel Oh Ross!\n",
      "Ross Hi!\n",
      "Rachel Thank God you’re here! You have to help me! Were you just talking to yourself?\n",
      "Ross That’s less embarrassing, yes. Yes I was.\n",
      "Ross (voiceover) So when she came in, I got distracted and totally forgot about the camera. [Cut back to the present day.] It kept rolling and recorded everything.\n",
      "Chandler Yeah, we’re gonna need to see that tape. (They rest of them agree.)\n",
      "Monica Yeah, definitely.\n",
      "Ross What a great idea! That will get Rachel to forgive me!\n",
      "Joey Y’know what? This is not fair to her. Let’s just forget the tape!\n",
      "Ross Thank you. (Joey mouths to Ross, \"You’ll show me right?\") No!\n",
      "Joey You’re right. (Mouths, \"I know you’ll show me, right?)\n",
      "Ross Joey! No!\n",
      "Joey Loud and clear! (Mouths, \"You’ll show me,\" and nods.)\n",
      "Monica I still don't get why Greg and Jenny would give us a fake number.\n",
      "Joey Y’know, if they knew what they were doing they probably didn’t give you real names either.\n",
      "Monica Okay, maybe people give out fake numbers, but they don’t give out fake names.\n",
      "Joey Oh yeah? (To Phoebe) Hi, Ken Adams, nice to meet you.\n",
      "Phoebe Regina Philange. (Ken and Regina shake hands.)\n",
      "Chandler I still don’t get it, we didn’t do anything wrong.\n",
      "Monica I know! Although, you did tell an awful lot of jokes.\n",
      "Chandler I thought you said those jokes were funny. Joke! Joke! Joke!\n",
      "Monica (rolling her head from side to side) Joke. Joke. Blah! Blah! (Joey and Phoebe laugh.)\n",
      "Chandler Well maybe it was all of your questions.\n",
      "Monica What about my questions?\n",
      "Chandler The sheer volume, it was like flying with the Riddler!\n",
      "Monica Oh, I’m sorry. Was that another joke?\n",
      "Chandler (angrily) Was that another question?\n",
      "Rachel (entering) Hey! Is Ross still here?\n",
      "Joey Uh no Rach, he’s gone. But listen, he told us what happened and it does, it sounds like an honest mistake.\n",
      "Rachel Oh really? Well how would you like it if I had sex with you and I taped it? (Joey smiles luridly) Oh forget it! (Ross enters.) Oh there he is now, the father of my child, the porn king of the west village.\n",
      "Ross Look, it was accident! Okay? I-I feel bad that it happened, but I swear, I didn’t even watch it! Anyway, here. (He takes the tape out of his coat pocket.) I thought you might be more comfortable destroying it yourself. (Tosses her the tape.)\n",
      "Rachel Thank you. (She sets it on the floor and is about to stomp on it with her shoe when the rest of the gang jumps up and yells simultaneously.) What? (They all yell again.) You don’t want to see this do you?\n",
      "Monica Hell yeah!!!\n",
      "Rachel I am not gonna show you this!\n",
      "Phoebe No! Not the sex part, just the stuff leading up to it.\n",
      "Ross Forget it, she’s destroying it.\n",
      "Phoebe Okay fine! Fine! We’ll just have to think of some other way to put the whole ‘Who came onto who,’ thing to rest! Come on now, think!!\n",
      "Ross Look, forget it Phoebe. Okay? It’s Rachel’s tape and she can do whatever she wants with it. And she wants to destroy it. So, end of story.\n",
      "Rachel I wanna see it.\n",
      "Ross What?!\n",
      "Rachel Clearly you don’t want people to see this tape. Now I don’t want people to see this tape either, but you so badly don’t people to see it makes me want to see it. You see?\n",
      "Joey (confused) Are we watchin’ the tape or not?!\n",
      "Ross I don’t want people to see it for your sake.\n",
      "Rachel Ahh, I don’t believe you. I think you don’t want them to see you begging me. (Goes to put the tape in the VCR)\n",
      "Ross Rachel, please…\n",
      "Rachel Ah, a little preview!\n",
      "Ross Fine. Fine, but I want the record to show that I tried to take the high road, because in about five minutes I’m gonna be saying…(He laughs and points at Rachel sarcastically.)\n",
      "Rachel Okay, here we go. (Pushes play.)\n",
      "Ross (on tape) Hello! Can I get you anything?\n",
      "Joey (To Phoebe) I’m so happy!\n",
      "Rachel (on tape) Oh, thank God you’re here! You have to help me! Were you just talking to yourself?\n",
      "Rachel There I am.\n",
      "Phoebe You’re gonna get pregnant.\n",
      "Rachel (on tape) I screwed up so bad, I told Monica that I would stuff and send all these wedding invitations like weeks ago and I-I…\n",
      "Ross (on tape) You didn’t do it?\n",
      "Rachel (on tape) I-I know—I had put them in…in-in my desk at work and I completely forgot about them until today.\n",
      "Monica (taking Rachel’s hand) Sweetie okay. It’s okay. Everybody made it to the wedding. I’m fine.\n",
      "Rachel Kinda hurtin’ my hand though.\n",
      "Monica I know.\n",
      "Rachel (on tape) (Ross hands her a glass of wine) I cannot believe that I did this. Especially after Monica just went on and on and on about it! (Mimicking Monica) \"Okay Rachel! Here are the invitations Rachel! Now be very careful Rachel! Please, drinking no liquids around the invitations Rachel!\" (She tilts her wine glass above and moves it back and forth across the invitations) Whoa oh! Oh-oh-oh! Oh…oh-oh-oh…\n",
      "Chandler Did you do it on our invitations?!\n",
      "Ross (pause) Not on the ones we sent out.\n",
      "Chandler So, just the ones gave back to us and we had framed! (Slams the framed invitation down onto the table.)\n",
      "Rachel (on tape) Can you believe this is already happening? I mean it seems like yesterday they just got engaged.\n",
      "Ross (on tape) I know. Hey remember…remember the night they got engaged? How uh, you and I almost…\n",
      "Rachel (on tape) Oh, I remember how we almost. Do you think we would’ve gone through with it? Y’know, if we hadn’t gotten caught. Do you think we would’ve done it?\n",
      "Ross (on tape) I mean I…I know I wanted to. I just, I just wasn’t sure if you wanted to.\n",
      "Rachel (on tape) Oh I wanted to.\n",
      "Ross (on tape) So we…we both wanted to.\n",
      "Rachel (on tape) Interesting.\n",
      "Ross (on tape) Yeah. (Pause) Anyway umm, it probably worked out for the best.\n",
      "Rachel (on tape) Oh yeah, sure.\n",
      "Rachel Okay, in about ten seconds you’re gonna see him kiss me.\n",
      "Ross And in about five seconds you’re gonna see why.\n",
      "Rachel (on tape) Ross did I ever tell you about the time that I went backpacking through Western Europe?\n",
      "Rachel Okay, get ready to see some beggin’!\n",
      "Phoebe Oh, you came on to Ross!\n",
      "Rachel What?!\n",
      "Ross Now I’m so happy.\n",
      "Rachel What are you talking about?!\n",
      "Monica You used the Europe story!\n",
      "Chandler That’s the magic story you use when you wanna have sex!\n",
      "Rachel How do you know about that story?!\n",
      "Joey How do you know about that story?!\n",
      "Rachel I heard it from my friend Irene who heard it from some guy!\n",
      "Joey (raises his hand) Some guy!! (Points to himself.)\n",
      "Rachel No. No, she told me his name was Ken Adams.\n",
      "Joey (raises his hand and points to himself again) Ken Adams!!\n",
      "Ross Hi.\n",
      "Rachel So uh, apparently people are familiar with the Europe story?\n",
      "Ross Yeah. Listen about that, the whole uh, who came on to who thing really doesn’t matter. I mean, I think it would’ve happened either way. I mean if you hadn’t initiated it I-I-I know I would’ve.\n",
      "Rachel It was an amazing night.\n",
      "Ross It was. It was an amazing night.\n",
      "Rachel You think it looked amazing?\n",
      "Ross I uh… I don’t know. I mean I…I honestly didn’t watch it.\n",
      "Rachel Yeah, me neither. Yet…\n",
      "Ross Uhhhhhh…that-that may be weird.\n",
      "Rachel Yeah, it would be really weird.\n",
      "Ross Good luck.\n",
      "Rachel Good luck to you.\n",
      "Ross Mind if I mute?\n",
      "Rachel Oh please. (He does so.)\n",
      "Ross Oh, oh there go the clothes.\n",
      "Rachel You are undressing very quickly.\n",
      "Ross Six months Rachel, six months.\n",
      "Ross and Rachel Ah. (Pause) Oh.\n",

      "Ross I—They would not let us get married when we were that drunk!\n",

      "Monica What are you guys gonna do?\n",
      "Rachel Well, I guess we just find a divorce lawyer? (Looks at Ross.)\n",
      "Chandler Well, I think, I think, Ross already has one. Now, this one’s free, right? Because you paid for the first two, so the third one’s free.\n",
      "Ross Laugh it up, but the joke’s on you. Because we don’t need to get divorced, okay? We we’re just gonna get an annulment.\n",
      "Joey An annulment? Ross! I don’t think surgery’s the answer here.\n",
      "Phoebe Oh-oh, that’s your thing.\n",
      "Ross What?\n",
      "Phoebe You’re thing. You’re thing. Y’know? You’re the guy who gets divorced.\n",
      "All Oh yeah!\n",
      "Ross No-no, that’s-that’s not my thing! I do not love getting divorced!\n",
      "Phoebe Yes you do! This is your third divorce! You love divorce so much you’re probably gonna marry it! Then it won’t work out and you’re gonna have to divorce it, divorcing guy. (Pause) I’m so drunk.\n",
      "Monica So, what do you think we should do?\n",
      "Chandler I don’t know. But I-I-I know I love you!\n",
      "Monica I know I love you! (They hug.)\n",
      "Chandler So where are we on the whole going back to the place where they have all the marriages thing? I love you.\n",
      "Monica That’s a good question. Look umm, last night we let the dice decide. Maybe we should leave it up to fate again. I love you!\n",
      "Chandler Yes, we don’t get married unless there’s a sign! Okay, so say uh, say you roll another eight (motions to the craps table) then there’s a definite sign that we should get married.\n",
      "Monica All right, eight we get married, but 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 9, 10, 11, 12 we don’t get married.\n",
      "Chandler Sounds great.\n",
      "Monica Okay. (They approach the craps table.)\n",
      "Croupler Coming in, we got a shooter! Money please.\n",
      "Monica Ready?\n",
      "Chandler Ready!\n",
      "Monica (sarcastic) Come on eight.\n",
      "Chandler (deadpan) Yes, yes eight.\n",
      "Croupler Eight! Easy eight. (She rolls a 3 and a 5 and they’re stunned.)\n",
      "Monica Wow! I can’t believe I actually rolled an eight.\n",
      "Chandler That was so unlikely. Well, let’s get married! I guess.\n",
      "Monica Wait a minute. That wasn’t a hard eight! Last night I rolled a hard eight.\n",
      "Chandler That’s right! It was the wrong kind of eight, no wedding! Damnit!\n",
      "Monica I wanted it so bad! (Pause) Wanna go pack?\n",
      "Chandler Yeah. (They go pack.) We’re doing the right thing, right?\n",
      "Monica Ohh, of course we are! (They walk up to the elevators.) We left it up to fate. (Pushes the elevator button.) If we were supposed to get married there would be a clear-cut sign. (The elevator door opens to a priest reading from a bible with Chandler and Monica standing side-by-side holding each other’s hands.)\n",
      "Phoebe Okay, you have 19 questions left. Use them wisely. (Joey groans.) Come on Joey! You can’t win if you don’t ask any (sees that he’s asleep) QUESTIONS!!!\n",
      "Joey (wakes up) What?!\n",
      "Phoebe Well, you promised me a fun road trip! We’ve been on the road six hours and you’ve been asleep for five and a half! We are switching at the next rest stop and you are going to drive all the way back! That will be your punishment, you greedy sleeper!\n",
      "Joey All right. All right.\n",
      "Phoebe Yeah! And until then you are going to sing to me because the radio’s broken and you are selfish but have a nice voice.\n",
      "Joey Really? I don’t…\n",

      "Joey (starts singing) I wanna rock and roll all night! (Falls asleep.)\n",
      "Joey (to himself) Man, this is a long drive! Are my eyes open? No! (He opens his eyes and sees a hitchhiker.)\n",
      "Hitchhiker (driving) Morning! (Phoebe screams again.)\n",
      "Ross Hey!\n",
      "Rachel Hey, hubby!\n",
      "Ross Yeah. Yeah, actually um, I wanted to talk to you about that whole annulment thing?\n",
      "Rachel Uh-huh.\n",
      "Ross I’m not going to do that. (Rachel glares at him.)\n",
      "Rachel Okay! So, we’ll just stay married.\n",
      "Ross Yes, exactly!\n",
      "Rachel And I will make everyone call me Mrs. Geller!\n",
      "Ross Wow! This is so amazing. I uh, I really thought I’d have to talk you into this more.\n",
      "Rachel Okay, see now I’m scared because I don’t actually think you’re kidding.\n",
      "Ross I’m-I’m not kidding. Look I-I, I can’t have three failed marriages. I can’t. Okay? I-I am not gonna be that guy!\n",
      "Rachel What-wh-what so we’ll just stay married forever?!\n",
      "Ross Okay, look, how is this gonna affect you? Really? I mean you fill some form out once and a while and instead of checking the box that says Ms you check the box that says Mrs.! It’s right next to it!\n",
      "Rachel Ohh, okay, I’m sorry. You’re right. Y’know what? We absolutely can stay married, because I was under the impression that the boxes were far away from each other. All right, look, just please, take a moment here and think about what you’re asking of me.\n",
      "Ross I’m asking you to do me a favor.\n",
      "Rachel You are asking me to be your wife!\n",
      "Ross And as my wife I think you should grant me this favor.\n",
      "Monica That kid really kicked me hard on the plane.\n",
      "Chandler Well you did pull his hair.\n",
      "Monica He took my snack!\n",
      "Chandler I’m not getting into this again!\n",
      "Monica Okay! Oh God, y’know what? It’s really bad.\n",
      "Chandler Well, I told you not to walk. Here. (Picks her up.) There. Okay. (He opens the door, carries her across the threshold, stops, backs out, and lets go of Monica who is only holding on by his neck.)\n",
      "Monica This doesn’t mean anything, does it?\n",
      "Chandler No!\n",
      "Monica Okay.\n",
      "Phoebe (To Joey) How could you pick up a hitchhiker?! He could be a rape—(She holds her hand in front of the hitchhiker’s face), a rapist or a killer or something!\n",
      "Joey Don’t you think I asked him that before he got in?!\n",
      "Phoebe Y’know what? I’m not talking to you! You go back to sleep! (To the hitchhiker) And you, are you a rapist?!\n",
      "Hitchhiker No!\n",
      "Phoebe Do you like car games?\n",
      "Hitchhiker Yeah, y’know the license plate game?\n",
      "Phoebe I love the license plate game!\n",
      "Joey Ooh, I’ll play! I’ll play!\n",
      "Phoebe No-No! You need your sleep. Night-night! Shh! (She closes the partition.)\n",
      "Ross Hey!\n",
      "Rachel Hey!\n",
      "Ross Listen, I know you wanted to talk to me, but I have an idea that may make you want to stay married. (Rachel shakes her head.) We register, and you get to keep all the presents!\n",
      "Rachel (thinks about it for a second) No! Ross, come on! No! Listen, look I thought a lot about how to tell you this and the bottom line, Ross, is we can not stay married.\n",
      "Ross I don’t know if it’s true.\n",
      "Rachel Oh b-b-but it is!\n",
      "Ross Oh, okay, y’know what this is? This is a difference of opinion. And when that happens in a marriage...\n",
      "Rachel Oh Ross, come on! This is not, this is not a marriage!! This is the world’s worst hangover! Ross, listen, if you do not get this annulment, I will!\n",
      "Ross All right. All right, I’ll do it.\n",
      "Rachel Thank you. (He goes to leave.) Hey-hey umm, uh, is there, is there any such thing as an annulment shower?\n",
      "Hitchhiker Wait! Wait! There is the train station!\n",
      "Phoebe Oh, okay.\n",
      "Hitchhiker This is where I get off. Well, I have your address and phone number.\n",
      "Phoebe And I have your name and the fact that you’re a drifter, so the ball’s pretty much in your court.\n",
      "Hitchhiker All right, see ya Pheebs. (Gets out and Phoebe drives away.)\n",
      "Joey Come on Pheebs! I can’t take this anymore! Let-let me make it up to you. Huh? (Starts singing.) Ground control to Major Tom. Commencing countdown, engines on. Take your protein pills and put your helmet on!\n",
      "Phoebe Stop it! Stop it no! That’s not fair! Y’know I can’t resist that beautiful voice!\n",
      "Joey Pheebs, I am so sorry! I know I promised you a fun road trip with your friend and I didn’t deliver. But-but-but now I know that you think being awake is an important part of friendship! So, so, so I will strive to-to stay awake for as long as I know you.\n",
      "Phoebe You can still sleep at night and stuff.\n",
      "Joey Well, thank you. So, can we play 20 Questions now? I’ve got a really good one! I’ve been thinking about it since Kansas.\n",
      "Phoebe Okay. Is it a kind of hot sandwich?\n",
      "Joey Yes.\n",
      "Phoebe Is it a meatball sub?\n",
      "Joey That is incredible! You are the master!\n",
      "Rachel Huh, that’s funny. You look like you’re gonna be the…\n",
      "Monica No, don’t say it! Don’t even think it!\n",
      "Rachel All right. Okay Chandler, enjoy your handful. (Exits.)\n",
      "Chandler All right, should we just, should we just get married? Y’know? I mean should we just do it? All the signs are telling us to do it.\n",
      "Monica I’m sick of the signs! It’s too fast, I’m happy the way things are!\n",
      "Chandler Me too!\n",
      "Monica I don’t want things to change! Do you?\n",
      "Chandler No!\n",
      "Monica All right then, then nothing changes! Everything is great! Everything stays the same! And you go unpack because it’s been three days and it’s driving me insane!\n",
      "Chandler Jeez, relax! It’s not like we’re mar-ah-ah!! (Runs out.)\n",
      "Chandler (entering, slowly) Y’know I was thinking, what if I uh, unpack here?\n",
      "Monica Then all your stuff would be here.\n",
      "Chandler Well, what if all my stuff was here?\n",
      "Monica Then you’d be going back and forth all the time, I mean it doesn’t make any sense.\n",
      "Chandler Okay. What if we lived together and you understand what I’m saying?\n",
      "Monica Live together? There have been no signs for that.\n",
      "Chandler Me asking is kind of a sign.\n",
      "Monica YES!!!!!!!!\n",
      "Chandler Okay!!!!!\n",
      "Monica Yes! Okay! Okay! Wait-wait-wait!\n",
      "Chandler Okay.\n",
      "Monica Here’s your key (Gets him one.)\n",
      "Chandler Oh thanks.\n",
      "Monica Here’s your key. All right, you have to christen it! Now, go out and come back in!\n",
      "Chandler The door hasn’t been locked in five years, but okay! (Runs out.) Ready?!\n",
      "Monica Ready!\n",
      "Chandler Okay, a little problem. The key broke in the lock and I can’t get in!\n",
      "Monica Wait! Oh my God! I can’t get out!\n",
      "Chandler This is not a sign!\n",
      "Monica No, it’s not a sign! It’s a very old key!\n",
      "Chandler It’s an old key!\n",
      "Monica Oh my God it’s old!\n",
      "Chandler I love you!\n",
      "Monica I love you!\n",
      "Chandler Are you hugging the door right now.\n",
      "Monica No.\n",

      "Ross Hey!\n",
      "Rachel Hey, so did everything go all right with the annulment?\n",
      "Ross Oh, yeah, no problems. It’s all taken care of.\n",
      "Rachel Ross, thank you. Hey, do you guys wanna go see a movie?\n",
      "Ross Oh yeah, why not?\n",
      "Rachel Pheebs?\n",

      "Ross I didn’t get the annulment.\n",
      "Phoebe What?!\n",
      "Ross We’re still married! Don’t tell Rachel. See you later. (He gets up leaving Phoebe in shock.)\n",
      "Joey What are you doing?\n",
      "Chandler The key’s stuck in the lock.\n",
      "Joey I can fix it. Hold on. (He goes and gets a screwdriver from his apartment) Look out. Look out. (Pries at the door a little bit.)\n",
      "Chandler (trying the handle) It still doesn’t work.\n",
      "Joey I’m not finished.\n",
      "Chandler Oh.\n",
      "Chandler Nice job Joe! You’re quite the craftsmen.\n",

      "Joey Ha-ha, very funny—Look! I don’t know what to do! I really want you guys to get along. Just please come to the movie with us. I mean you owe me!\n",
      "Monica We owe you?!\n",
      "Joey That’s right! I helped you guys out a lot in the start of your relationship. Huh? I helped you guys sneak around for like six months, and I looked like an idiot! And I was humiliated. And I only made 200 dollars!\n",
      "Monica We didn’t give you any money! (Chandler is motioning, \"No!\")\n",
      "Joey You don’t think I know that!\n",
      "Rachel …see I can’t decide whether it would go better next to the new wicker dining chair, the Sahara desk, or the Parker console table.\n",
      "Ross Wow! I didn’t know that there was a Pottery Barn up here.\n",
      "Rachel I know, I know. I went a little crazy.\n",
      "Ross A little? Your place looks like page 72 of the catalogue. Oh look at that! The ornamental bird cage! Large!\n",
      "Phoebe (entering) Hey!\n",
      "Rachel Hey.\n",
      "Phoebe (sees Ross) Oh Ross no. Be careful, that is very old! Okay? Early Colonial bird merchants used to bring their birds to market in that.\n",
      "Ross (glaring at Rachel) Fascinating.\n",
      "Phoebe (gasps) Another amazing find! Wow! Oh I bet this has a great story too!\n",
      "Rachel Oh it does, it does! It is a room separating apparatus from Colonial times.\n",
      "Phoebe Ah!\n",
      "Ross Hmm, a lot of this stuff is from Colonial times. Hey, what are some other time periods Rachel? (She glares at him.)\n",
      "Rachel Well there’s yore. And uh, y’know, yesteryear.\n",
      "Phoebe Yeah no, I’m telling you Rachel has such a great eye for this stuff. Ross, y’know if you ever decide you need to redecorate—And I think that you should. You should, you should ask Rachel to help.\n",
      "Rachel Oh honey he doesn’t need my help.\n",
      "Phoebe Oh, come on! I think he’s ready to get rid of, what did you call it? The cheap knock-offs and dinosaur junk.\n",
      "Ross Really?! (To Rachel) Hey, y’know what? Since you have such a great sense of what I need, uh ooh, here’s-here’s 60 bucks, why don’t you take Phoebe down to that Colonial flea market of yours and get me some stuff.\n",
      "Rachel (not sure of what to do) Y’know what? I don’t, I don’t think Phoebe really wants to come.\n",
      "Phoebe No! I do want to!\n",
      "Rachel Oh, she does want to.\n",
      "Ross She does want to.\n",
      "Phoebe Yeah!\n",
      "Rachel Pheebs, I don’t know what to say. I guess the flea market was just better last time.\n",
      "Phoebe Well at least I got these sheets for Ross.\n",
      "Rachel Yeah.\n",
      "Phoebe Uck, look at this! Pottery Barn, yuck!\n",
      "Rachel Yeah, y’know what? Don’t look at it. (Realizes the display is their living room) Seriously, don’t look at it. (Tries to pull Phoebe away.)\n",
      "Phoebe No! Look-look! There’s the coffee table they stole from us!\n",
      "Rachel Ugh, those bastards! Let’s go.\n",
      "Phoebe That fan kinda looks like ours. And the birdcage and the…wait a sec! This is our exact living room!\n",
      "Rachel No! No! No! No it’s not! No it’s not! Come on! Phoebe, ours is totally different! I mean we don’t have the… (Looks desperately for something different.) We don’t have the…that lamp! And-and that screen is y’know, on the other side.\n",
      "Phoebe Oh my God. This is where you got all our stuff, Pottery Barn! Oh my God!\n",
      "Rachel Okay! Okay-okay look—no I did, I just wanted this stuff and I know how you feel about Pottery Barn. Just… Come on don’t be mad.\n",
      "Phoebe No-no-no, but I am mad! I am mad! Because this stuff is everything that is wrong with the world! And it’s all sitting up in my living room and all I can think about is how I don’t have that lamp!\n",
      "Rachel Well then honey, buy the lamp! Hey, we have that 60 bucks from Ross.\n",
      "Phoebe I can’t! I can’t! Unless… Well are you saying that-that you would move out if-if I didn’t buy that lamp?\n",
      "Rachel What?! No! I’m not gonna move out!\n",
      "Phoebe But are you saying that you would move out if I didn’t buy that lamp?\n",
      "Rachel (gets it) Oh. Yes! I would so move out!\n",
      "Phoebe Okay then I don’t have a choice! I have to buy that lamp!\n",
      "Rachel That’s right!\n",
      "Phoebe But at least the apothecary table is real.\n",
      "Joey Well, this-this-this was great. Didn’t everybody have a great time?\n",
      "Janine Well I did. I really did. And you guys, I’ve got to say, I’m sorry if I was a little weird after the last time we went out. I guess I was just nervous or something.\n",
      "Chandler That’s totally understandable.\n",
      "Monica Don’t worry about it.\n",
      "Janine So we can go out again?\n",
      "Chandler Oh yeah!\n",
      "Monica Absolutely!\n",
      "Janine Oh good.\n",
      "Joey Oh well then, good night!\n",
      "Monica Good night! (They go into their respective apartments.)\n",
      "Joey See? Eh, wasn’t that fun?\n",
      "Janine We have got to move!\n",
      "Monica (bursting in) I knew it!! Y’know, you’re not so quiet yourself, missy!\n",
      "Chandler And I’m blah? Listen, the only thing more boring than watching modern dance is having to listen to you talk about it, (Imitating her) \"Oh Chandler, I just lost myself in the moment.\"\n",
      "Janine Y’know, I know you’re talking, but all I hear is, \"Blah. Blah. Blah-blah-blah.\"\n",
      "Monica (steps up and points at her) All right! You and me! Let’s go! Right now!\n",
      "Joey All right! All right! Enough! Enough! Enough!! Enough! (To Chandler and Monica) You two go home! I-I-I gotta talk to Janine! (They start to leave.)\n",
      "Chandler (To Monica) Y’know I think you can take her.\n",
      "Monica (to Janine) You’d better hope I don’t see you in the hallway!! (They exit.)\n",
      "Joey All right, uh, we’ve got a little bit of a problem here. These people are my friends; you can’t treat them that way.\n",
      "Janine They said stuff to me too, y’know!\n",
      "Joey I know! I know! And I’m going to talk to them about it. They mean so much to me. They… They’re like my family. If you guys are gonna be fighting all the time, I-I… I don’t think we can be together. It just, it just can’t work. It can’t. (Starts to break up) I’m very upset.\n",
      "Janine Okay. Okay. Would, would it help if I went over and apologized?\n",
      "Joey Yeah! Yeah! That would be very helpful! Yeah. (He opens the door for her and she exits into the hallway.)\n",
      "Monica What did I tell you about the hall?!\n",
      "Janine I was just coming over here to apologize for my behavior! I’d really like it if we could be friends.\n",
      "Monica Well, I know that would make Joey happy, so, I would like that too.\n",
      "Janine Great.\n",
      "Monica Now come on. (They hug like men.) Well, I’m glad we worked things out.\n",
      "Janine Me too.\n",
      "Monica Okay.\n",
      "Janine I’ll see you.\n",
      "Monica Bye. (Leaves to resume her garbage removal task.)\n",
      "Janine (muttering to herself) Or I’ll hear you.\n",
      "Monica (hearing that) That’s it big girl! (Hits Janine in the butt with the garbage bag) Come on!\n",
      "Janine Wait! (Janine pauses, then runs down the stairs.)\n",
      "Monica (chasing her) You’d better run!\n",
      "Chandler Did you hear that?\n",
      "Joey Yeah uh, what am I gonna do?\n",
      "Chandler Yeah, I’m sorry man. (Pause) You wanna go watch?\n",
      "Joey Yeah! (They head downstairs.)\n",
      "Ross Hey!\n",
      "Joey How ya doin’?\n",
      "Chandler Hey so, did uh, did she move out?\n",
      "Joey Pretty much, yeah.\n",
      "Monica I cannot believe you broke up with her just like that.\n",
      "Joey Well, when it’s not right, you know it.\n",
      "Chandler You okay?\n",
      "Joey Yeah! Yeah. I’ll be all right.\n",
      "Ross Y’know what would cheer you up?\n",
      "Joey What?\n",
      "Ross I’m giving this lecture on erosion theories tomorrow night, I think you should come.\n",
      "Joey (laughing hysterically) You’re right! That did cheer me up!\n",

      "Rachel Yeah.\n",
      "Gunther Do you remember when you first came here, how you spent two weeks getting trained by another waitress?\n",
      "Rachel Oh, sure! Do you need me to train somebody new?\n",
      "Gunther (laughs) Good one. Actually, ah, Terry wants you to take the training again, whenever.\n",

      "Chandler (thinks about it) Yeah?\n",
      "Sarah So that’s two boxes of the Holiday Macaroons. On behalf of the Brown Birds of America, I salute you. (Does the Brown Bird salute, she blows on a bird call, then holds her hand, palm facing out, next to her face, and then waves it like a bird flapping it’s wings.)\n",
      "Ross Just admit it Chandler, you have no backhand.\n",
      "Chandler Excuse me little one, I have a very solid backhand.\n",
      "Ross Shielding your face and shrieking like a girl... is not a backhand.\n",
      "Chandler I was shrieking... like a Marine.\n",
      "Ross All right here. Watch me execute the three ‘P’s of championship play. Power. (swings the racquet) Precision. (swings the racquet.) and penache. (does a backswing and hits Sarah who’s started up the stairs, knocking her down, they both watch in horror.)\n",
      "Monica You broke a little girl’s leg?!!\n",
      "Ross I know. I feel horrible. Okay.\n",

      "Phoebe Have fun. Oh wait, no, don’t! I forgot I am totally against that now.\n",
      "Joey What? Me having a job?\n",
      "Phoebe No, no, I am against innocent trees being cut down in their prime, and their, their corpses grotesquely dressed in like tinsel and twinkly lights. (to Joey) Hey, how do you sleep at night?\n",
      "Joey Well, I’m pretty tired from lugging the trees around all day. Hey, Phoebe listen, you got this all wrong. Those trees were born to be Christmas trees, their fulfilling their life purpose, by, by making people happy.\n",

      "Chandler Yes. Yes, and ah, ah, the trees are happy too, because for most of them, it’s the only chance to see New York.\n",

      "Gunther What if you put them here. (sets the empty tray on another stack of empty trays on the back counter.)\n",
      "Rachel Huh. Well, y'know that’s actually a really good idea, because that way they’ll be closer to the mugs. Y'know what, you should have the other waitresses do that too.\n",
      "Gunther They already do. That’s why they call it the ‘tray spot.’\n",
      "Rachel Gee, I always heard them talk about that, I just always thought that it was a club they went to. Oh God, I’m, I’m sorry. (walks away)\n",
      "Gunther It’s all right. Sweetheart.\n",
      "Ross So, this must be kinda neat for ya, huh? I mean, your Dad tells me that you get a couple of days off school, and you, you ah, don’t have to sell those cookies anymore.\n",
      "Sarah Well, I kinda wanted to sell the cookies. The girl who sells the most wins a trip to Spacecamp, and gets to sit in a real space shuttle.\n",
      "Ross Wow, you ah, you really like all this space stuff, huh?\n",
      "Sarah Yeah. My Dad says if I spend as much time helping him clean apartments, as I do daydreaming about outer space, he’d be able to afford a trip to the Taj Mahal.\n",
      "Ross I think you would have to clean a whole lot of apartments to go all the way to India.\n",
      "Sarah No. The one in Atlantic City, Dad loves the slots. He says he’s gonna double the college money my Grandma left me.\n",
      "Ross Huh. Well, good luck to Dad. Say, how many more boxes would you have to sell in order to win?\n",
      "Sarah The girl who won last year sold four hundred and seventy-five.\n",
      "Ross Yeah.\n",
      "Sarah So far, I’ve sold seventy-five.\n",

      "Sarah Five dollars a box.\n",
      "Ross (puts away his wallet) And what is second prize?\n",
      "Sarah A ten speed bike. But, I’d rather have something my Dad couldn’t sell.\n",
      "Ross Well, that makes sense.\n",
      "Sarah Could you do me one favor, if it’s not too much trouble?\n",
      "Ross Yeah, Sarah, anything.\n",
      "Sarah Could you pull open the curtains for me? The astronauts from the space shuttle are gonna be on the news, and since we don’t have a TV, the lady across the alley said she’d push hers up to a window, so I could watch it.\n",
      "Woman (looking through her peephole, we see Ross standing in the hallway.) Yesss?\n",

      "Ross No, hi, I’m, I’m an honorary Brown Bird (does the Brown Bird salute.)\n",
      "Woman What does that mean?\n",
      "Ross Ah, well, it means that I can sell cookies, but I’m not invited to sleep-overs.\n",
      "Woman I can dial 9-1-1 at the touch of a button, y'know. Now, go away!\n",
      "Ross No, please, please, um, it’s for a poor little girl who wants to go to Spacecamp more than anything in the world.\n",
      "Woman I’m pressing, a policeman is on his way.\n",
      "Ross Okay, okay! I’m going. I’m going. (goes across the hall to knock on another door.)\n",

      "Phoebe (walking up to Joey) Hey.\n",
      "Joey Hey. What, what are you doing here?\n",
      "Phoebe Well, I-I thought a lot about what you said, and um, I realilized duh, all right maybe I was a little judgmental. Yeah, (looks at the tree) oh, but oh...\n",
      "Joey Look now, Phoebe remember, hey, their just fulfilling their Christmas....\n",
      "Phoebe Destiny.\n",
      "Joey Sure.\n",
      "Phoebe Yes.\n",
      "Joey All right.\n",
      "Phoebe Okay. (One of Joey’s co-workers, walks by with a dead tree.) Yikes! That one doesn’t look very fulfilled.\n",
      "Joey Oh, that’s, that’s ah, one of the old ones, he’s just taking it to the back.\n",
      "Phoebe You keep the old ones in the back, that is so ageist.\n",
      "Joey Well we have to make room for the fresh ones.\n",
      "Phoebe So, what happens to the old guys?\n",
      "Joey Well, they go into the chipper.\n",
      "Phoebe Why, do I have a feeling that’s not as happy as it sounds? (Joey points out one going into the chipper to her, as this haunty, demonic music starts to play in the background) No! Nooooo!!! (she winces in horror and hides her face against Joey’s shoulder, as she sees the tree spit out from the chipper.)\n",
      "Joey (to the guy operating the chipper) Hey! Hey!! (makes the ‘cut it’ motion with his hands)\n",
      "Ross ...and these come in the shapes of your favourite Christmas characters, Santa, Rudolph, and Baby Jesus.\n",
      "Joey All right, I’ll take a box of the cream filled Jesus’s.\n",
      "Ross Wait a minute, one box! Come on, I’m trying to send a little girl to Spacecamp, I’m putting you down for five boxes. Chandler, what about you?\n",
      "Chandler Ahh, do you have any coconut flavoured deities?\n",
      "Ross No, but ah, there’s coconut in the Hanukkah Menoreoes. I tell you what, I’ll put you down for eight boxes, one for each night.\n",
      "Ross Mon?\n",
      "Monica All right, I’ll take one box of the mint treasures, just one, and that’s it. I-I started gaining weight after I joined the Brown Birds. (to Ross) Remember, how Dad bought all my boxes and I ate them all?\n",
      "Ross Ah, no Mon, Dad had to buy everyone of your boxes because you ate them all. But ah, y'know I’m sure that’s not gonna happen this time, why don’t I put you down for three of the mint treasures and just a couple of the Rudolph’s.\n",
      "Monica No.\n",
      "Ross Oh, come on, now you know you want ‘em.\n",
      "Monica Don’t, don’t, don’t, don’t, don’t do this.\n",
      "Ross I’ll tell you what Mon, I’ll give you the first box for free.\n",
      "Monica (she reaches out for it and stops) Oh God! I gotta go! (runs out)\n",
      "Ross Come on! All the cool kids are eating ‘em! (chases after her.)\n",
      "Gunther And when you have a second later, I wanna show you why we don’t just trap spiders under coffee mugs and leave them there.\n",
      "Rachel (sitting down next to Chandler) I’m training to be better at a job that I hate, my life officially sucks.\n",
      "Joey Look Rach, wasn’t this supposed to a temporary thing? I thought you wanted to do fashion stuff?\n",
      "Rachel Well, yeah! I’m still pursuing that.\n",
      "Chandler How... exactly are you pursuing that? Y'know other than sending out resumes like what, two years ago?\n",
      "Rachel Well, I’m also sending out.... good thoughts.\n",
      "Joey If you ask me, as long as you got this job, you’ve got nothing pushing you to get another one. You need the fear.\n",
      "Rachel The fear?\n",
      "Chandler He’s right, if you quit this job, you then have motivation to go after a job you really want.\n",
      "Rachel Well then how come you’re still at a job that you hate, I mean why don’t you quit and get ‘the fear’?\n",
      "Chandler Because, I’m too afraid.\n",
      "Rachel I don’t know, I mean I would give anything to work for a designer, y'know, or a buyer.... Oh, I just don’t want to be 30 and still work here.\n",
      "Chandler Yeah, that’d be much worse than being 28, and still working here.\n",
      "Gunther Rachel?\n",
      "Rachel Yeah.\n",
      "Gunther Remind me to review with you which pot is decaf and which is regular.\n",
      "Rachel Can’t I just look at the handles on them?\n",
      "Gunther You would think.\n",
      "Rachel Okay, fine. Gunther, y'know what, I am a terrible waitress, do you know why I’m a terrible waitress? Because, I don’t care. I don’t care. I don’t care which pot is regular and which pot is decaf, I don’t care where the tray spot is, I just don’t care, this is not what I want to do. So I don’t think I should do it anymore. I’m gonna give you my weeks notice.\n",
      "Gunther What?!\n",
      "Rachel Gunther, I quit.\n",
      "Chandler (to Joey) Does this mean we’re gonna have to start paying for coffee? (Joey shrugs his shoulders.)\n",
      "Ross ....and 12, 22, 18, four... (Chandler starts laughing) What?\n",
      "Chandler I spelled out boobies.\n",
      "Monica (comes up and starts looking through Ross’s cookie supply) Ross, but me down for another box of the mint treasures, okay. Where, where are the mint treasures?\n",
      "Ross Ah, we’re out. I sold them all.\n",
      "Monica What?\n",
      "Ross Monica, I’m cutting you off.\n",
      "Monica No. No, just, just, just a couple more boxes. It-it-it’s no big deal, all right, I’m-I’m cool. You gotta help me out with a couple more boxes!\n",
      "Ross Mon, look at yourself. You have cookie on your neck.\n",
      "Monica (covers her neck) Oh God! (runs to the bathroom)\n",
      "Chandler So, how many have you sold so far?\n",
      "Ross Check this out. Five hundred and seventeen boxes!\n",
      "Chandler Oh my God, how did you do that?\n",
      "Ross Okay, the other night I was leaving the museum just as ‘Laser Floyd’ was letting out of the planetarium, without even trying I sold 50 boxes! That’s when it occurred to me, the key to my success, ‘the munchies.’ So I ah, started hitting the NYU dorms around midnight. I am selling cookies by the case. They call me: 'Cookie Dude!'\n",
      "Rachel (entering) Okay, stop what you’re doing, I need envelope stuffers, I need stamp lickers.....\n",
      "Ross Well hey, who did these resumes for ya?\n",
      "Chandler Me! On my computer.\n",
      "Ross Well you sure used a large font.\n",
      "Chandler Eh, yeah, well ah, waitress at a coffee shop and cheer squad co-captain only took up so much room.\n",
      "Rachel Hey-hey-hey that’s funny! Your funny Chandler! Your a funny guy! You wanna know what else is really funny?!\n",
      "Chandler Something else I might have said?\n",
      "Rachel I don’t know, I don’t know, weren’t you the guy that told me to quit my job when I had absolutely nothing else to do. Ha! Ha! Ha! Ha! Ha!!\n",
      "Ross Sweetie, calm down, it’s gonna be okay.\n",
      "Rachel No, it’s not gonna be okay Ross, tomorrow is my last day, and I don’t have a lead. Okay, y'know what, I’m just gonna, I’m just gonna call Gunther and I’m gonna tell him, I’m not quitting.\n",
      "Chandler You-you-you don’t wanna give into the fear.\n",
      "Rachel You and your stupid fear. I hate your fear. I would like to take you and your fear....\n",
      "Joey (entering, interrupting Rachel) Hey! I got great news!\n",
      "Chandler Run, Joey! Run for your life! (runs out)\n",
      "Joey What? Rachel, listen, have you ever heard of Fortunata Fashions?\n",
      "Rachel No.\n",
      "Joey Well my old man is doing a plumbing job down there and he heard they have an opening. So, you want me to see if I can get you an interview?\n",
      "Rachel Oh my God! Yes, I would love that, oh, that is soo sweet, Joey.\n",
      "Joey Not a problem.\n",
      "Rachel Thanks.\n",
      "Joey And now for the great news.\n",
      "Ross What, that wasn’t the great news?\n",
      "Joey Only if you think it’s better than this... (holds up an aerosol can) snow-in-a-can!! I got it at work. Mon, you want me to decorate the window, give it a kind of Christmas lookie.\n",
      "Monica Christmas cookie?\n",
      "Joey Okay, and ah, this one here is a Douglas Fir, now it’s a little more money, but you get a nicer smell.\n",
      "Guy Looks good. I’ll take it.\n",
      "Phoebe (running up carrying a tree) Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait! No, no, you don’t want that one. No, you can have this cool brown one. (points to the almost dead tree she has)\n",

      "Phoebe All right y'know what, nevermind! Everyone wants to have a green one! I’m sorry, I’m sorry, I didn’t mean to get so emotional, I guess it’s just the holidays, it’s hard.\n",

      "Ross Hi there!\n",
      "Leader Hi. And batting for Sarah, Ross Geller, 872. Although, it looks like you bought an awful lot of cookies yourself.\n",
      "Ross Um, that is because my doctor says that I have a very serious.... nuget.... diffency.\n",
      "Chandler Tell us what happened, Brown Bird Ross.\n",

      "Rachel’s Boss Now Mr. Kaplan Sr. likes his coffee strong, so your gonna use two bags instead of one, see. Now pay attention, ‘cause this part’s tricky, see some people use filters just once.\n",
      "Ross I’m, I’m sorry you didn’t get to go to Spacecamp, and I’m hoping that maybe somehow, this may make up for it. Presenting Sarah Tuttle’s Private Very Special Spacecamp!! (opens the door and Chandler and Joey jump up, their apartment is decorated like outer space, one of the leather chairs is covered in tinfoil.)\n",
      "Sarah Really Mr. Geller, you don’t have to do this.\n",

      "Joey Okay, really good. Anyway I gotta go; I’m late for work.\n",
      "Rachel What-what?! You’re gonna leave this person with me?!\n",
      "Joey Yeah—Hey, don’t worry, she’s a terrific girl. And hey listen, could you do me a favor? When she comes out could you just mention that I’m not looking for a serious relationship; that’d be great.\n",
      "Rachel Why?! What?! Are you kidding?!\n",
      "Joey Just casually slip it in, y’know lay the groundwork. Tell her uh, I’m a loner—No! An outlaw! Tell her she doesn’t want to get mixed up with the likes of me.\n",
      "Rachel Y’know what? That’s a lot to remember, can’t I just tell her you’re a pig?\n",
      "Joey Hey, I’m gonna call her later! Honest! Oh come on, Chandler used to do it! He’d even make the girl pancakes! Plus, he’d make extras and leave ‘em for me.\n",
      "Rachel Well forget it, I’m not telling that girl anything. That is not my responsibility.\n",

Yeah, it’s right-it’s right down here! In the biggest library in the university! (They start heading that way, towards a secluded section behind the racks.)\n",
      "Chandler Wow that’s actually pretty cool.\n",
      "Ross (stopping quickly) Oh umm, there’s also a book here by a woman named Wendy Bagina. (They both laugh, but stop when the hear moaning coming from the next aisle.) What is that?\n",

      "Ross Let me ask you something, at your school was there a like uh a place on campus where students went to uh, fool around.\n",
      "Rachel Yeah, there was. It was—there the corner of the library where-where all these dusty books that nobody ever read—Yes, there was.\n",

      "The Head Librarian How can I help you?\n",

      "The Head Librarian We are aware of the problem you are referring too. (He turns to look at the previous librarian.) But as far as increasing security, I’m afraid the library is very understaffed. I, I can’t help you.\n",
      "Ross Well, fine. Fine! If-if I’m the only person with any appreciation of the sanctity of the written word, I’ll go up there and defend it myself! (Starts to do so, but stops and to the previous librarian) And don’t you follow me!\n",

      "Janice Well umm, I thought I was going to go back to my apartment but then I just felt I couldn’t really be alone tonight. (Joey walks into view of the open door behind Janice, sees her, gets a terrified look on his face, and flees in horror.) I was wondering if I could maybe stay here with you, just I really feel that I need to be with family.\n",
      "Monica (To Chandler) Our kids are gonna call her Aunt Janice aren’t they?\n",
      "Janice Please, it’s because otherwise I really don’t know what I might do.\n",
      "Chandler Aren’t you just a tinsy bit curious?\n",
      "Janice (starting to cry) Do you have any tissues?\n",
      "Monica Yeah, in-in-in the bathroom.\n",
      "Janice Okay! (She runs for the bathroom)\n",
      "Monica We’ll just…we’ll just let her stay.\n",
      "Chandler No-no-no-no, if we let her stay, she will stay forever!\n",
      "Monica Kinda like your Barca lounger.\n",
      "Chandler Is that what you’re thinking about right now?\n",
      "Monica I never stop thinking about it.\n",
      "Janice Hey you guys, umm do either one of you want to get in there before I take my bath.\n",
      "Chandler Janice, I’m sorry but umm, you can’t stay here tonight.\n",
      "Janice Why not?\n",
      "Chandler Honestly? Our apartment is a hotbed for electromagnetic activity. Now Monica and I have been immunized, but sadly you have not.\n",
      "Janice Okay, I’m going to need a comforter, but did you have a hypoallergenic one because otherwise I get very nasal. (Makes some weird sound) Do you have a cat? ‘Cause it’s already happening. (Makes a nasal sound) Do you hear that? (She keeps making the nasal sound.)\n",
      "Monica Oh my God! Oh my God! You have to go!\n",
      "Janice Why?\n",
      "Monica Because Chandler still has feelings for you!\n",
      "Janice He does?\n",
      "Chandler Say again?\n",
      "Monica That’s right. That’s right. And that is why you can’t stay here tonight. And probably why you shouldn’t come to the wedding.\n",
      "Chandler Feelings, such strong feelings.\n",
      "Monica I mean, I realize that his feelings may never completely go away, but you can.\n",
      "Janice Oh…my Gawd, I-I understand. I-I am so sorry, I’ll go. (Starts for the door.) Good-bye Monica (hugs her), I wish you a lifetime of happiness with him. Chandler, (hugs him) you call me when this goes in the pooper. (Hurries out.)\n",
      "Ross (to the guard) Don’t sweat it, I’ve got this section covered. Yeah, in fact I’ve got this little baby (Turns on a mini-flashlight) to shine in people’s eye—(The guard walks away)—Okay, see you later.\n",

      "Ross (noticing a beautiful woman moving in down the street) Well hello! She’s cute! Should we uh, go try to talk to her?\n",
      "Chandler Sure! That’s one of the great things about being engaged. I’m not nervous talking to pretty girls anymore.\n",

      "Kristen But-but this block is like a whole other world.\n",
      "Ross Y’know actually it does have a very interesting history. Uh, this street is the first street in the city to have an underground sewer system. (Kristen crinkles her nose at that.) Before that sewage and waste would just flow right down the street. Yeah, sometimes ankle deep! (He stops when he realizes what he’s talking about.)\n",

      "Kristen You look strong, why don’t I take that and you grab one of the boxes.\n",
      "Joey Okay. Yeah. (She leaves and he goes to pick up a box marked books, but decides to take the box marked pillows instead.) Yeah, I’ll grab this one. (He follows her upstairs.)\n",
      "A Woman What is taking so long?! I mean whatever!\n",
      "Rachel (To Phoebe) So this is Brooklyn.\n",
      "Monica All right, listen up. There is usually only one dress in each size so when they open those doors, fan out. Now, this is what you’re looking for! (Holds up a picture of it.) Memorize it! When you locate the dress, blow on these. All right? (She passes out whistles to them.) Three short blasts, when you hear it. Come running.\n",

      "Monica No. No. Not it. Not it. Not it. (Checks another rack and another woman tries to reach around her.) (To the woman) Don’t crowd me! (Finds it) This is it! This is the dress! Oh my God, it’s perfect! (She takes it off of the rack and someone has a hold of it on the other side of the rack and tugs on it.) I’m sorry, this one’s taken!

      "Woman Hey!\n",
      "Phoebe Okay! (Runs that way and hears another whistle blast.) Hey! (Heads the other way and hears another blast.) What do I do?!! (She runs in the second direction and finds that the whistling is coming from inside a rack. She moves the dresses out of the way to find Rachel curled up in a fetal position frantically blowing on the whistle.) What are you doing? (Rachel doesn’t stop.) Did you find the dress? (Rachel won’t stop so Phoebe pinches her nose shut which causes her to spit the whistle out.)\n",
      "Phoebe Did you find the dress?\n",
      "Rachel No! You gotta get me out of here Phoebe! These bargain shoppers are crazy!\n",
      "Phoebe I—We gotta get Monica. (She starts to leave.)\n",
      "Rachel No! You gotta hold my hand!!\n",
      "Phoebe Oh my God!! (She grabs Rachel’s hand and drags her towards Monica.) Excuse me! Excuse me! (She’s knocking women and veils out of the way as she moves.)\n",
      "Monica (handing Phoebe the dress) Go! Go! Go!\n",
      "Rachel (seeing who’s trapped) Hey…\n",
      "Monica NOW!!!!!!!! (Rachel runs off and Monica gets up to follow her.)\n",
      "Chandler So Ross, how was your date the other night? Did you tell her about the magical ride that starts with the flush of every toilet?\n",
      "Ross Laugh all you want but uh, she actually left me a message saying she’d like to go out again.\n",
      "Chandler Huh.\n",
      "Ross Yeah in fact, I’m gonna go call her right now. And I’ll make sure to tell her my friend Chandler says… (He mimics the shy reaction Chandler did.)\n",
      "Joey (entering) Hey Chandler!\n",
      "Chandler Hey!\n",
      "Joey Listen, sorry I didn’t stop by last night but I had a date.\n",
      "Chandler Uh Joe, when it’s one o’clock in the morning and you don’t come by? That’s okay!\n",
      "Joey Well check it out, I was with this really hot girl who just moved in right across the street!\n",
      "Chandler Really? Right across the street?\n",
      "Joey Yeah!\n",
      "Chandler When’d you meet her?\n",
      "Joey Two days ago.\n",
      "Chandler Excellent! Y’know Ross met somebody too!\n",
      "Joey Oh yeah?\n",
      "Ross (returning) Hey.\n",
      "Chandler Hi! How’d it go?\n",
      "Ross Oh great! We’re going out again Saturday. But I just found she’s also seeing some other guy.\n",
      "Chandler (sarcastically shocked) Really?! Joe? What would you do if you were in Ross’s situation?\n",
      "Joey Well, I sorta am. I mean yeah, I’m dating this girl who’s also seeing another guy. But, I don’t know, I’m not to worried about it.\n",
      "Ross Well you shouldn’t be. Believe me I wouldn’t want to be the guy who’s up against you. (Chandler laughs.) I mean that doofus is going to lose!\n",
      "Chandler So this is nice! I wish I didn’t have to go, believe me! But unfortunately I have to. (He gets up and Joey moves over next to Ross.) Oh uh, by the way, what’s the name the girl you’re dating?\n",
      "Joey and Ross Kristen Lang.\n",
      "Chandler Bye! (Exits.)\n",
      "Ross Well obviously only one of us can keep dating her.\n",
      "Joey Obviously! So, how do we decide?\n",
      "Ross Well now let’s-let’s look at this objectively, I think I should date her…\n",
      "Joey (not buying it) Uh-huh. Uh-huh. Or, or I’m the one who dates her.\n",
      "Ross That’s interesting, but check this out. I date her…\n",
      "Joey Yeah-yeah I like that but just to go in another direction…\n",
      "Ross Okay, okay. This can go on for a while.\n",
      "Joey Yeah well we should order some food then.\n",
      "Ross No Joey! Look why don’t, why don’t we just let her decide? Okay? Hey-hey, we’ll each go out with her one more time. And-and we’ll see who she likes best.\n",
      "Joey (smiling) That sounds fair.\n",
      "Ross Maybe I’ll take her to that new French restaurant down the street…\n",
      "Joey Ah yeah—wait a second now! Look we’re gonna have to set a spending limit on the date. I don’t have the money to take her to a fancy place like that.\n",
      "Ross Well sorry, that’s what I do on dates.\n",
      "Joey All right, well I guess I’ll just have to do what I do on dates.\n",
      "Ross So let’s decide on the spending limit…\n",
      "Joey Yeah. Uh, (thinks)…a slice…(Thinks)…six dollars?\n",
      "Ross I was thinking more like a hundred.\n",
      "Joey Okay. Can I borrow 94 dollars?\n",
      "Monica Oh…\n",
      "Phoebe I know. Hand me a tissue. (Monica hands her one.)\n",
      "Rachel You’re out of Diet Coke.\n",
      "Monica Hello? (Listens) What?! (Listens) You what?! (Listens) Hey you listen here missy! (Listens) Wh—(She is hung up on.)\n",
      "Phoebe What?!\n",
      "Monica That was that girl Megan! She booked the Swing Kings on the day of our wedding and said that I couldn’t have them back unless I gave her the dress!\n",
      "Phoebe (gasps) Does that mean Carcass is available?\n",
      "Monica What am I gonna do?! That is the dress! That is the dress! Wh…Chandler wants the band. What do I do?\n",
      "Phoebe Well just figure out a way to talk him out of it.\n",
      "Monica How?\n",
      "Rachel You’re out of toilet paper!\n",
      "Joey (entering) Hey!\n",
      "Ross Hey! What’s up?\n",
      "Joey I just wanted to come by and y’know, wish you good luck on your date.\n",
      "Ross Oh thanks!\n",
      "Joey Yeah. What time are you meeting her?\n",
      "Ross We have 8:00 reservations at Grammercy Bistero.\n",
      "Joey Wow, that’s in like 20 minutes. You’d better get dressed.\n",
      "Ross I am dressed.\n",
      "Joey Oh. Well good! (To himself) For me. (He picks up a jar of lotion.) What is this? Did you give yourself a facial?\n",
      "Ross I have an oily T-zone!\n",
      "Joey Okay dude! (Finds a receit.) Hey you uh, you sent Kristen flowers.\n",
      "Ross That’s right.\n",
      "Joey You spent a hundred dollars. That’s the limit. You’re screwed!\n",
      "Ross Uh actually, I sent the flowers before the actual date. So techincally, technically I didn’t break any rules. Thanks for stopping by though.\n",
      "Joey Oh-oh! So that’s the way it’s gonna be huh? Yeah I can break the rules too y’know!\n",
      "Ross Oh yeah? What are you gonna do?\n",
      "Joey I don’t know.\n",
      "Ross Why am I not surprised?\n",
      "Joey Y’know what Ross? I’m not gonna let you get away with this!\n",
      "Ross I don’t think you have much choice.\n",
      "Joey Well we’ll see!\n",
      "Ross Bye-bye!\n",
      "Joey Yeah bye-bye! (Exits and comes back in still holding the lotion.) Hey! So just a light layer?\n",
      "Ross Yes. Yes. Just here (Runs his fingers down the bridge of his nose) and there (Runs his fingers across his forehead).\n",
      "Chandler Joey got meat sauce on the banister again! (He goes into the bathroom to wash his hands.)\n",
      "Phoebe Yeah, swing music is so out.\n",
      "Monica Phoebe, he’s gotta be in the room for that to work.\n",
      "Chandler (returning) What are you guys talking about?\n",
      "Monica Well umm, we were just talking about the y’know, the Swing Kings and just wondering whether y’know, they were the right way to go.\n",
      "Rachel Yeah, I went to a wedding once where they had swing music and uh, two months later the couple got divorced. And now I’m not saying that there’s any connection here y’know, but they did tell me that’s why they got divorced.\n",
      "Chandler But I love swing music!\n",
      "Phoebe Yeah but the Swing Kings? Y’know they suck so much that people actually die at their concerts—They just stop living.\n",
      "Chandler Look all I know is when Monica and I went to see them, we had fun! And there’s another reason too.\n",
      "Rachel Well, what is the other reason?\n",
      "Chandler I don’t want to say.\n",
      "Rachel Well you have to because maybe it’s stupid.\n",
      "Chandler Well it’s just while Monica and I were dancing to them it was…the first time I knew that…you were the woman I wanted to dance all my dances with.\n",
      "Monica Oh crap!\n",
      "Ross So they said our table will be ready in just a few minutes.\n",
      "Kristen Oh great!\n",
      "Ross Yeah.\n",
      "Kristen Is your back feeling better?\n",
      "Ross Oh yeah it’s fine. I guess the more muscles you have the more they can spasim out of control.\n",
      "Joey (entering) Kristen?\n",
      "Kristen Joey!\n",
      "Joey Hi!\n",
      "Kristen Hi! What are you doing here?\n",
      "Joey Oh I like this place. And technically, technically I’m not breaking any rules so I…\n",
      "Kristen Well uh, Ross? This is Joey. Joey? Ross.\n",
      "Joey Hi!\n",
      "Ross Hi. (They shake hands.) It’s nice to meet you. I used to have a friend named Joey. I don’t anymore.\n",
      "Kristen Our table will be ready in a couple minutes.\n",
      "Ross Yeah. So…\n",
      "Joey Sure! I would love to wait with you guys! Thanks! (Sits down.)\n",
      "Ross So Joey umm, you look familiar. Are uh, are you on TV or something?\n",
      "Kristen Well Joey doesn’t like to talk about it but, he’s one of the stars of Days Of Our Lives.\n",
      "Ross That’s right! That’s right, don’t you play a woman?\n",
      "Joey A woman in a man’s body.\n",
      "Ross Much better.\n",
      "Joey So y’know Ross it’s funny ‘cause, you look familiar to me too. Have you ever been married?\n",
      "Ross Well yes, yes I have. In fact umm, just the other day Kristen and I were talking about how I’ve been married and how I have a son.\n",
      "Kristen Yeah, little Eric.\n",
      "Ross That’s right! Wait no, Ben.\n",
      "Joey So you’ve just married the one time then?\n",
      "Ross Well umm…\n",
      "Kristen You’ve been married twice?\n",
      "Ross Yes. And another time after that. Boy I’m getting hungry! Hey Joey, have you ever been so hungry on a date that when a girl goes to the bathroom you eat some of her food?\n",
      "Kristen You said the waiter ate my crab cake.\n",
      "Joey (laughs that one off) Yeah. So uh Ross, well now—why did that first marriage breakup? Was it because the woman was straight or she was a lesbian?\n",
      "Kristen Do you two know each other?\n",
      "Joey and Ross No. No.\n",
      "Joey No. It just seems like Ross is the kind of a guy that would marry a woman on the verge of being a lesbian and then push her over the edge.\n",
      "Ross Wait a minute! Were you on a poster for gonorrhea?\n",
      "Joey Have you ever slept in the same bed as a monkey?!\n",
      "Ross Hey you leave Marcel out of this!\n",
      "Joey Fine! Have you ever got stuck in a pair of your own leather pants?!\n",
      "Ross Hey-hey have you ever locked yourself in a TV cabinet VD boy?!\n",
      "Joey Monkey lover!\n",
      "Joey When do you think we lost her?\n",
      "Ross Probably around gonorrhea.\n",
      "Chandler Hi, honey! I’m home!\n",
      "Monica (from the bedroom) Don’t come in here!\n",
      "Chandler Why? Do you another boyfriend in there or something?\n",
      "Monica No! We only mess around at his place!\n",
      "Chandler Y’know it’s funny I started it but, now it’s scary me. So could you come out here please?\n",
      "Monica No, I’m wearing a wedding dress.\n",
      "Chandler Oh you got a wedding dress? That’s great!\n",
      "Monica Yeah but I’m not keeping it.\n",

      "Monica Gotcha. When do we tell them about this?\n",

      "Phoebe They went in together. So sorry.\n",
      "Monica Oh my God! Oh my God that’s awful! What did you think of the house?\n",
      "Phoebe What?\n",

      "Joey I knew he couldn't be with a woman for 45 minutes!!\n",
      "Phoebe Why do you have a realtor?\n",
      "Monica Uhm, she has been showing us houses outside of the city.\n",
      "Joey (clearly shocked) What?\n",
      "Rachel Are you serious?\n",
      "Monica When we found out that we're gonna get this baby, Chandler and I started talking and we decided that we didn't want to raise a kid in the city.\n",

      "Chandler Little toast here. I know this isn't exactly the kind of Thanksgiving that all of you all planned, but for me, this has been really great, you know, I think because it didn't involve divorce or projectile vomiting. Anyway, I was just thinking, I mean, if you'd gone to Vail, and if you guys'd been with your family, if you didn't have syphilis and stuff, we wouldn't be all together, you know? So I guess what I'm trying to say is that I'm very thankful that all of your Thanksgivings sucked.\n",

And now when I look over, who am I gonna see? The Gottliebs, the Yangs? They don't make me feel so good. (Joey pats Ross on his back)\n",
      "Rachel Yeah. So don't move, okay? Just stay here and... (nods towards Ross) maybe close your blinds at night.\n",

      "Chandler Well, I didn't know how to tell you before, but... We got the house.\n",
      "Monica Enjoy!\n",

      "Chandler Wow umm, calm down.\n",
      "Phoebe I'm trying, but man that guy can push my buttons!\n",
      "Monica Why are so mad at him?\n",
      "Phoebe Look, I don't wanna talk about it. Okay?\n",
      "Monica Well, it just seems that…\n",
      "Phoebe You wanna be on my list too? Keep talking! Has anyone seem my list by the way?\n",
      "Chandler Uh, no Pheebs. What's it look like?\n",
      "Phoebe Uh, it's a piece of paper and it says, \"Ross\" on it.\n",
      "Joey (entering, depressed) Hey. I just got off the phone with Estelle and guess what. (Pause, then very excitedly) I GOT THE LEAD IN A MOVIE!!!!!!\n",
      "Chandler You got the lead in a movie? That's amazing! What's the movie about?!\n",
      "Joey It's called Shutter Speed, it's really cool! Yeah, umm, I meet this girl in the subway and we fall in love in like a day, right? And then, she disappears… But I find out where she lives and when I get there this like old lady answers the door and I say, \"Where's Betsy?\" Right? And she says, \"Betsy's been dead for 10 years.\"\n",
      "Phoebe Ohh-oh, chilling!\n",
      "Joey And the best part is, we're filming in the desert outside Vegas! (To Chandler) And you know what that means buddy!\n",

      "Joey Road trip! Yeah, we can rent a car! I just have to be there by Tuesday!\n",
      "Phoebe Oh wait, my grandmother's dead.\n",
      "Chandler Well, uh, we can talk about that too Pheebs.\n",
      "Phoebe No! No, her cab! She probably won't be using it; you can drive it to Las Vegas.\n",
      "Joey All right! Thanks Pheebs!\n",
      "Chandler Whoa-whoa-whoa, what are we going to do about my job?\n",

      "Monica Chandler! You don't have to ask for my permission. (Quietly) You can go.\n",
      "Chandler Thank you.\n",
      "Monica Hey Rach, come on! We're gonna be late for the eye doctor appointment!\n",
      "Rachel (entering from her bedroom) All right! Let's get this over with! Ugh! (She walks by the table and notices that no one is looking and accidentally on purpose knocks over the open cereal box.) Ohhh! No! Look what I did! (She starts walking through the mess. {Also, notice the continuity error in this scene. Note the position of the box and dispersal pattern of the cereal before and after the camera cut.}) Oh, I mean, look at this mess! I mean, we're probably gonna have to clean this up! Y'know? We're gonna have to reschedule!\n",
      "Monica No. If you thought this mess is going to bother me, you are wrong! All right, let's go Blinky! (She ushers Rachel out the door, but before the door fully closes she sticks her head back in.) Chandler!!!! (Chandler agrees to clean up the mess.)\n",
      "Phoebe Oh hey Joey! What's up?\n",
      "Joey I can't decide which route to take to Vegas. Hey, you've traveled a lot right?\n",
      "Phoebe Yeah, I've been around.\n",
      "Joey Okay, so-so which route should I take the northern route or the southern route?\n",
      "Phoebe Ooh, if you take the northern route there's a man in Illinois with a beard of bees. {Okay, I must protest this, I've lived in Illinois all my life and know of no man with a beard of bees! Wisconsin, on the other hand, might be a different story.}\n",
      "Joey Great! Problem solved!\n",
      "Phoebe But on the southern route there's a chicken that plays tic-tac-toe.\n",
      "Joey Well, back to square one.\n",
      "Phoebe Oh, I know a way that you can decide! All right, I'm going to ask you a series of questions and you answer as quickly as you can.\n",
      "Joey (quickly) Yes!\n",
      "Phoebe Good, but wait. Okay, all right, here we go. Now I want you to relax. Take a deep breath. Clear your mind. (Quickly) Which do you like better peanut butter or egg whites?\n",
      "Joey Peanut butter!\n",
      "Phoebe Which would you rather be a fireman or a swimmer?\n",
      "Joey A swimmer!\n",
      "Phoebe Who would you rather sleep with Monica or Rachel?\n",
      "Joey Monica. Oh… huh, I always thought it would be Rachel.\n",
      "Phoebe No thinking! No thinking! Tie or ascot?\n",
      "Joey Ascot!\n",
      "Phoebe North route or south route?\n",
      "Joey North route!\n",
      "Phoebe Bamn! There you go! Huh?\n",
      "Joey Wow! That was incredible! Beard of bees, here I come!\n",
      "Ross (entering) Hey!\n",
      "Phoebe Oh, this guy again. (She ignores him.)\n",
      "Joey Hey man, what's up?\n",
      "Ross Uhh, not much. You guys want to see a movie tonight?\n",
      "Joey Sure, what do you want to see?\n",
      "Ross I don't know, umm…\n",
      "Joey Oh, I know how we can decide. Phoebe, show him your game!\n",
      "Phoebe Umm, no thank you. (She gets up and moves to the couch. They were at a table previously.)\n",
      "Ross What's with her?\n",
      "Joey I don't know. But hey, I know we can decide. Okay, I'm gonna ask you questions and you answer real quick. Okay?\n",
      "Ross Okay.\n",
      "Joey What do you like better action or comedy?\n",
      "Ross Action.\n",
      "Joey Who would you rather sleep with Monica or Rachel?\n",
      "Ross Dude, you are sick.\n",
      "Joey Oh, I'm sorry. I forgot you had that whole Rachel thing.\n",
      "Rachel Oh my God! What does that thing do?\n",
      "Monica (looks at it more closely) Oh that's an eye removal machine.\n",
      "Rachel All right, I'm outta here!\n",
      "Monica I'm kidding! I'm kidding!\n",
      "The Doctor Hi Rachel!\n",
      "Rachel Hey!\n",
      "The Doctor I'm Dr. Miller. Monica told me you were a little nervous, but don't worry everything's gonna be just fine.\n",
      "Rachel So were done then!\n",
      "Dr. Miller Almost! But first, we gotta start.\n",
      "Rachel Okay.\n",
      "Dr. Miller This is a glaucoma test.\n",
      "Rachel Uh-huh.\n",
      "Dr. Miller Sit down.\n",
      "Rachel Okay.\n",
      "Dr. Miller But your chin here. (She does so.) Now, you'll feel a small puff of air in each eye.\n",
      "Rachel (jerks back from the tester) What?!\n",
      "Monica A small puff of air, now come on!\n",
      "Dr. Miller Here we go.\n",
      "Rachel All right.\n",
      "Dr. Miller 1…2…3! (Rachel jerks back on 3.)\n",
      "Rachel I'm sorry. All right, I'll just stay in here this time. (Puts her head back.) Okay.\n",
      "Dr. Miller Ready?\n",
      "Rachel Uh-huh.\n",
      "Dr. Miller 1…2… (She flinches on 2 this time.)\n",
      "Monica Y'know what, I'm gonna hold her head.\n",
      "Rachel Okay.\n",
      "Dr. Miller That's okay.\n",
      "Monica Okay. (Monica backs off.)\n",
      "Rachel Okay. Okay!\n",
      "Dr. Miller 1…2! (She flinches again.) (Gives up.) Y'know what? You're young; you probably don't have glaucoma.\n",
      "Rachel (really excited) Great!! It was very, very nice to meet you sir--Ow! Hey! What are you doing?! Are you crazy! (He took out that thing they use to look at people's retinas and looked at Rachel's when she was shaking his hand causing her to flinch and scream at him.)\n",
      "Dr. Miller Okay. You've got a small, minor infection in that left eye. I want you to take these drops three times a day and you'll be as good as new.\n",
      "Rachel Yeah, no, I don't-I don't put things in my eye.\n",
      "Dr. Miller Okay then, I guess we'll see you back here in three months.\n",
      "Rachel Great!\n",
      "Dr. Miller And I'll fit you for a glass eye.\n",
      "Rachel Okay, just give me the damn drops! (Grabs them and storms out.)\n",
      "Monica Dr. Miller? (She covers her right eye and reads from the chart) P E C F D.\n",
      "Dr. Miller Very good Monica! You know where they are.\n",
      "Monica I sure do! (She runs over to a drawer, opens it, and grabs a lollipop.) (To Rachel) And you don't get one!\n",
      "Rachel Y'know, I-I gotta tell ya, those eye drops are a miracle. My eye is a 100% better.\n",
      "Monica They're still in my coat.\n",
      "Rachel Damn!\n",
      "Chandler (entering) Hey!\n",
      "Joey Hey! You ready to go?\n",
      "Chandler Yeah, listen, how cold is it going to be there? Do I need a coat or will all these sweater vests be enough? (Holds up 3 of them in different colors.)\n",
      "Chandler What?\n",
      "Monica I love you.\n",
      "Joey Man, I wish Ross was coming with us! Y'know? I'm gonna miss him!\n",
      "Phoebe Thanks a lot! I just got that jerk out of my mind!\n",
      "Chandler Hey, so where are we staying? Is the movie putting us up in a big hotel suite?\n",
      "Joey Uh no, not really. It's an independent film y'know? So we don't have a real big budget. I figured I'd just stay in your room.\n",
      "Chandler I see, but once you get your first paycheck you'll be springing a big hotel suite, right? I mean, lead in a movie, they must be paying you a lot?\n",
      "Joey Oh yeah! For every dollar Shutter Speed makes, one penny of it goes right in Joey's pocket.\n",
      "Chandler So you don't get paid unless the movie makes money?\n",
      "Joey Did you not hear the plot of the movie? \"She's been dead for ten years.\" I'm gonna be a millionaire!\n",
      "Ross (entering) Hey!\n",
      "Joey Hey!\n",
      "Ross I just wanna say good-bye to you guys and to see if you guys will place a little bet for me, huh? Twenty bucks on black 15.\n",
      "Joey You got it!\n",
      "Ross All right!\n",
      "Chandler All right, bye-bye now!\n",
      "Phoebe Bye!\n",
      "Rachel Bye you guys!\n",
      "Joey Bye-bye!\n",
      "Monica I wanna say good-bye at the car!\n",
      "Chandler Okay!\n",
      "Joey Anybody want to say good-bye to me at the car?\n",
      "Rachel Oh honey, I'll say good-bye to you at the car if you don't mind the puss.\n",
      "Joey See ya! (Walks out.)\n",
      "Rachel Well, wait a minute! The puss is good! It means it's healing! (Runs after him.)\n",
      "Ross Hey Pheebs, what 'cha reading? (Phoebe ignores him) Pheebs? (Turns away) Hello? (He sits down next to her and she moves over a bit.) Phoebe? (He moves closer and she keeps moving away.) Phoe-Phoebe! (They end up hanging over the arm rest.) Come on! (He grabs the magazine away from her.)\n",
      "Phoebe Oh, I'm sorry. I didn't see you there.\n",
      "Ross Phoebe, are you, are you mad at me, or something? 'Cause if are please, tell me what it is I did!\n",
      "Phoebe Well, if you don't know I can't help you.\n",
      "Ross Well, I don't know.\n",
      "Phoebe Well, I can't help you.\n",
      "Ross Well, whatever it is I'm-I'm very, very sorry. Okay?\n",
      "Phoebe Apology accepted.\n",
      "Ross Okay. So we're, we're good?\n",
      "Phoebe Uh-huh.\n",
      "Ross All right. (Gets up.) I'll uh, I'll see you later, okay?\n",
      "Phoebe (quietly) Bye, fat ass.\n",
      "Ross ALL RIGHT!! Phoebe now come on! Will you please tell me what it is I did that mad you so mad at me!\n",
      "Phoebe I don't know! I don't remember!\n",
      "Ross Well if you can't remember, can't we just forget about this?\n",
      "Phoebe Oh no, I am mad at you. I know that much. But, I am sorry about the fat ass thing. You actually have a very sweet little hiney.\n",
      "Joey Man, I'm getting pretty tired. You're might have to take over soon.\n",
      "Chandler We've been driving for a half-hour, and you haven't looked at the road once.\n",
      "Joey Don't worry, it's out there! (Just then a horn honks and Joey quickly looks at the road.) I think I just need lunch.\n",
      "Chandler Yeah.\n",
      "Joey You wanna eat? (Pulls out the twenty) My treat!\n",
      "Chandler Isn't that Ross's money?\n",
      "Joey Yeah. Okay. Ross's treat! Where do you wanna eat?\n",
      "Chandler I don't know.\n",
      "Joey Ooh, hey, I know how we can decide! All right, uh, I'm gonna ask you a bunch of questions and then you have to answer real fast. Okay? So uh, clear your mind Clear it right out! Clear it out! Clear!\n",
      "Chandler Okay!\n",
      "Joey Okay, uhh, would you rather be too wet or too dry?\n",
      "Chandler Too dry.\n",
      "Joey Do you believe in ghosts, yes or no?\n",
      "Chandler No!\n",
      "Joey Is this movie gonna be my big break?\n",
      "Chandler No!\n",
      "Joey (shocked) What?!\n",
      "Chandler Yes.\n",
      "Joey Dude you said, \"No!\"\n",
      "Chandler I also said, \"Yes!\"\n",
      "Joey You don't think this is going to be a big break for me?\n",
      "Chandler No! (Realizes) Ahhh!!!\n",
      "Joey I don't believe this!\n",
      "Chandler Look Joe, I just, I just don't want to get your hopes up real high.\n",
      "Joey What are you talking about?! I'm the lead in a movie!\n",
      "Chandler They're not even paying ya! This doesn't even sound like a real movie!\n",
      "Joey Y'know what? I don't need this! Okay? I don't know why you're dumping all over my big break.\n",
      "Chandler Joe, I don't think this is going to be your big break.\n",
      "Joey Is that why you're on this trip, huh? Make me feel like a loser? 'Cause if it is, I'll tell ya, I-I-I'd rather be alone.\n",
      "Chandler Oh, you don't want me on the trip?\n",
      "Joey Not if you're gonna be like this!\n",
      "Chandler All right, I'll tell ya what, the next time you ask me a question like that I'll lie.\n",
      "Joey Yeah! I don't want you on the trip!\n",
      "Chandler All right, fine! Fine! Why don't you pull over? I'll get out right now!\n",
      "Joey Fine! (He slams on the brakes, stopping the car on the bridge to the sound of numerous car horns.) Get out!\n",
      "Chandler You're not actually supposed to stop on the bridge.\n",
      "Joey Get out!!\n",
      "Chandler All right!! (Gets out and Joey speeds away.) Wait! Wait, there's no sidewalk! Yeah, I'm gonna die here.\n",
      "Ross Okay, are you mad at me because my hair gel smells?\n",
      "Phoebe No.\n",
      "Ross Are you angry at me because I said your handwriting is childlike?\n",
      "Phoebe No that made me feel precious.\n",
      "Monica Oh, I know! Umm, is it because he's always correcting people's grammar? Whom! Whom! Sometimes it's who!\n",
      "Ross Yeah? Sometimes it's… (Does the fist thing.)\n",
      "Rachel Oh, did you beat him at a board game? He turns into such a baby when he starts to lose.\n",
      "Ross Okay, I'm the baby. (Points at his eye.)\n",
      "Rachel Eh! Stop it!\n",
      "Chandler (entering) Hey!\n",
      "Monica Chandler! What are you doing here?\n",
      "Ross Hey!\n",
      "Chandler Joey kicked me out of the car on the George Washington bridge!\n",
      "All Why?!\n",
      "Chandler I don't know! He went crazy! Y'know, we were playing that game where you-you ask a question and you answer it really fast.\n",
      "Phoebe That game should not be played without my supervision.\n",
      "Chandler Well, I don't know what mad him so mad, y'know? All I said was that uh, I didn't think this wasn't gonna be his big break, that this movie wasn't going to do anything for him, and that uh, y'know it didn't sound like a real movie--Okay, he should've pushed me off of the bridge.\n",
      "Phoebe What's in the bag?\n",
      "Chandler Oh, I figured you guys would all be mad at me. So I got you some gifts that I found on the side of the road. (Looks into the bag.) Who wants the teddy bear with one leg?\n",
      "Phoebe I do!\n",
      "Rachel Okay. (She tilts her head back and squeezes the eyedropper. The only problem is, it's not over her eye.)\n",
      "Monica Not even close.\n",
      "Rachel Okay, then y'know what? Help me! I need help! I can't do this!\n",
      "Monica Okay! All right! Let's do it!\n",
      "Rachel All right!\n",
      "Monica Sit down. (They sit down on the couch.)\n",
      "Rachel All right.\n",
      "Monica Put your head back.\n",
      "Rachel Yes!\n",
      "Monica All right.\n",
      "Rachel Okay.\n",
      "Monica Now, open your eyes.\n",
      "Rachel Okay, they are. (No they're not.)\n",
      "Monica How many fingers am I holding up? (She's not holding any up.)\n",
      "Rachel (thinks) Four.\n",
      "Monica Oh my God, I was thinking four.\n",
      "Rachel Really?!\n",
      "Monica Yes! All right, y'know what? Why don't we start with a practice run? Okay?\n",
      "Rachel Okay!\n",
      "Monica No drops!\n",
      "Rachel Great!\n",
      "Monica Okay.\n",
      "Rachel Okay.\n",
      "Monica On three, 1…2…3! (Rachel turns her head on three to avoid the drops.) Now my pillow's all wet! (She was trying to fool Rachel and squeezed the eyedropper.)\n",
      "Rachel Well, well, you said it was practice!\n",
      "Monica Then why did you move?!\n",
      "Rachel Because I knew you were lying!\n",
      "Monica All right, come here! (She gets up and drags Rachel off of the couch by her legs.)\n",
      "Rachel (as she's being dragged) What are you? Monica!! Stop it!! Oh my God! Stop it! (Monica drags her totally onto the floor and on her back.)\n",
      "Monica I am going… I'm going--Turn it over! (Rachel rolled onto her stomach and Monica rolls her back.) I'm… I am going to get these drops in your eyes. (She is holding Rachel down with both hands and has the eyedropper in her mouth.)\n",
      "Rachel Oh my God! You really are freakishly strong!\n",
      "Rachel Monica! Stop it!\n",
      "Monica (spitting out the eyedropper) Damn! It's empty!\n",
      "Rachel Wow, y'know if Joey and Chandler walked in right now, we could make a fortune! (Monica is straddling Rachel and holding her arms down. In a rather risqu� pose, at least for primetime TV.)\n",
      "Phoebe Ooh that is definitely Chandler, Joey, or Ross. (Thinks) Or-or Rachel!\n",
      "Monica (answers the phone) Hello? (Listens.) (To Phoebe) It's Joey. (Phoebe's proud of herself.) (To Joey) I'm so glad you called! Chandler told me what happened. Y'know he's really upset about it.\n",
      "Joey (on a pay phone holding a box) Not as upset as he's gonna be when he finds out what I did with his sweater vests!\n",
      "Monica What did you do to his sweater vests?\n",
      "Joey Let's just say there's a well-dressed pack of dogs in Ohio. Hey Monica listen is-is Phoebe there? I gotta ask her something about the car.\n",
      "Monica Yeah, she's here. Hold on a second. (She hands the phone to Phoebe.)\n",
      "Phoebe Hey, dude!\n",
      "Joey Hey Pheebs! Listen, this wooden box keeps sliding out from under the seat. What-what is it?\n",
      "Phoebe Oh that's my grandma. (Joey holds the box away from him.) And thanks Joey she's having a really great time. (Joey is happy now.)\n",
      "Chandler (who has just entered) Is that Joey? Is that Joey? Let me talk to him! I wanna talk to him!\n",
      "Phoebe Okay Joey? Chandler's here, he was wondering… (We hear the dial tone as Joey hangs up.) Okay, I guess he ran out of change.\n",
      "Chandler Y'know, he won't even talk to me. How am I going to apologize to him if he won't even talk to me?\n",
      "Monica Well, maybe you should send him something. So that when he gets to Las Vegas he'll know that you're sorry.\n",
      "Chandler That's a good idea. I wonder where I could (Pause) get a basket of porn…\n",

      "Gavin Is this your first appology?\n",
      "Rachel No, I just mean that, you know, first impressions don't mean anything. And I-I think you're a really good guy and I'm sorry that I misjudged you.\n",

      "Rachel Hello. (to Gavin) But you know what, hey, new day, new leaf, I am just really really happy ... (sees Gavin staring at Heather) I'm sorry, obviously Heather's ass has something more important to say so I'll just wait 'till it's finished.\n",
      "Gavin What?\n",
      "Rachel I was giving you an appology and you were totally checking her out!\n",

      "Gavin I thought it was ok when you slept with your old assistant Tag.\n",
      "Rachel That is totally different for two reasons. One - I didn't know that you knew that. And two, I wasn't some creep staring at his ass, we had a deap meaningful relationship.\n",
      "Gavin Huh. What's Tag's last name?\n",
      "Rachel It was ... (can't remember) oh my god. He didn't have a last name. It was just \"Tag\". You know, like Cher, or, you know, Moses.\n",
      "Gavin But it was a deap meaningful relationship.\n",

      "Rachel Because it took us months to find a good nanny and I wouldn't want anything to, you know, drive her away.\n",
      "Joey So, what, you think I'm just gonna sleep with her and never call her again and things are gonna get uncomfortable? (thinks about it) Yeah, sounds about right.\n",

      "Chandler Yes, as a matter of fact he did, so I can't let you go.\n",

      "Monica Does he?\n",
      "Rachel What?\n",
      "Monica Maybe he's bothering you so much because he likes you. It's like in first grade when Skippy Langwild always pushed me on the playground because he secretly had a crush on me?\n",
      "Rachel Oh, Monica, you think Skippy liked you? Honey, all those buys had a bet to see if he can knock you over.\n",

      "Rachel Ahhhh , you brought rats to my birthday party?\n",
      "Monica So this is what a stroke feels like.\n",
      "Phoebe I had to bring them! We killed their mother, they're our responsibility now. You know, they require constant care. You should know that, Rachel, you're a mother.\n",
      "Rachel Are you comparing my daughter to a rat?\n",
      "Phoebe No! Seven rats! I think we should take them home, we need feed them.\n",
      "Rachel whhh wait, you're gonna leave my party to take care of a box of rats?\n",
      "Phoebe Well I'm sorry Rachel, but I'm not like you, ok? Not everyone can afford help. (she and Mike leave)\n",
      "Ross Where the hell are Joey and Molly? I asked you to watch them.\n",
      "Chandler (In a helium voice, holding a balloon) I'm sorry, I got a little occupied.\n",

      "Chandler (still helium voice) Right behind you, big guy! (they both head for the door)\n",
      "Joey So you see, Molly, what people don't understand is that acting is a discipline. It takes a lot of hard work.\n",
      "Molly So where did you study?\n",

      "Molly No, where did you study acting?\n",

      "Ross What do you think you're gonna do, have sex with her right here on my couch?\n",
      "Joey No ... the leather sticks to my ass. You know, this isn't fair. What makes you think that I'm just gonna sleep with her and then blow her off? Huh? Can't you guys open your minds to the possibility that I actally like her, and might want something real? (pause) Look, the truth is, I haven't felt this way about anyone since Rachel, ok? I didn't think I could ever love again.\n",
      "Ross and Chandler Come on! Joe!\n",
      "Joey Ok (admits)\n",
      "Woman Hi, is Molly here?\n",

      "Joey It's like my favorite fairy tale come true! (Chandler looks at him) The princess, the stable boy and the lesbian!\n",
      "Phoebe Ok, ok, you start preparing the formula and I start changing the box and then we gotta put them straight to bed.\n",
      "Mike Hey, when did we become one of those couples whose lives revolve around their rats?\n",
      "Phoebe Well, you know what, they're our responsibility now.\n",
      "Mike Ok, fine, these rats are our responsibility. What happens when they mate and there are hundreds of them?\n",
      "Phoebe Mate? They're all brothers and sisters.\n",
      "Mike Yeah - not such a problem with rats. No, they're more of a \"love the one you're with\" kind of animals.\n",
      "Phoebe No. (opens the box) wh - get off your sister! Oh my god, what are we gonna do? We have 7 rats. So what if each of them has 7 rats? And then each of those have 7 rats? That's like ... (starts counting with her fingers) That's math I can't even do! What are we gonna do?\n",
      "Mike Well, I know this is gonna sound crazy, but, we could not let the box of rats ruin our lives.\n",
      "Phoebe Yeah, ok. I guess you're right. Allright, so we should just give them away. But to nice families, with children, and reduced fat wheat thins. They're Bob's favorites.\n",
      "Mike It's gonna be ok.\n",
      "Phoebe You must think I'm crazy.\n",
      "Mike No, I think you're sweet.\n",
      "Phoebe Good. It's just so hard, it's hard for me to ... let them go. I guess it just brings back memories, you know, from ... when I gave birth to my brother's triplets and I had to give them up. (Mike is shocked) I haven't told you about that yet, have I?\n",
      "Monica Hey!\n",
      "Rachel Hi. Thanks for the party, honey. Should I help you clean up?\n",
      "Monica No way! You had your party, now I have mine! Is everything alright?\n",
      "Rachel Yeah, I just get a little bummed when my birthday's over.\n",
      "Monica Well, at least you have one thing to be happy about. That jerk Gavin from your office didn't show up (Gavin shows up at the balcony windows).\n",
      "Rachel Mmm hmm.\n",
      "Gavin Yeah, hey. (comes in to the balcony)\n",
      "Monica Oh, we weren't talking about you. No, no way to recover.\n",
      "Rachel No.\n",
      "Gavin Nice party.\n",
      "Rachel Well, it was, and you would have seen it if you didn't showed up at (looks at his watch) ... 9:30?? God! Oh, this party was lame ...\n",
      "Monica (from inside) Again, you're welcome.\n",
      "Gavin Look, I'll just give you this and go.\n",
      "Rachel Oh, you bought me a present! Why?\n",
      "Gavin Well, let me explain how birthday parties usually work. There are presents, and a cake, perhaps a fourth or fifth person. Ok, I ... got you the present to make up for being such a jerk to you earlier.\n",
      "Rachel Aww. Well, ok, well that's very nice. And you wrote a card (opens the card). \"From Gavin\"\n",
      "Gavin I really mean it.\n",
      "Rachel (opens the present, it's a green scarf) Awww, awww, it's beautiful.\n",
      "Gavin You don't mind? (puts it around her neck) Well, what do you know, it fits!\n",
      "Rachel See, Gavin, you're capable of being a nice guy. Why did you give me such a hard time?\n",

      "Monica Okay what’s up\n",
      "Chandler Umm, you know how we always said that it would be fun to move to Paris for a year? You know, you could study French cooking and I could write and we could take a picnic along the Seine and go wine tasting in Bordeaux?\n",
      "Monica Oh yeah (smiles).\n",
      "Chandler Okay, you know how that people say that Tulsa is the Paris of Oklahoma?\n",

      "Monica Are you trying to tell me that we’re moving to Oklahoma, or that you’re gay? All right, not that this matters, but did they at least offer you a huge raise?\n",
      "Chandler No, no, but they are going to lease us a Ford Focus. (Monica’s not impressed.) I’ll get out of it.\n",
      "Monica Thank you.\n",

      "Ms. McKenna What?\n",
      "Chandler It’s a funny story, actually. (coughs) I kind of fell asleep in the meeting this morning so when I said I’d move to Tulsa, I didn’t really know what I was saying.\n",
      "Ms. McKenna You fell asleep?\n",
      "Chandler But only because I was up all night worried about this meeting, ain’t that funny? Irony? Not a fan, alright (he sits down). See, here’s the thing. I went home and told my wife about Tulsa and she won’t go. See, me, I love Tulsa!  Tulsa is heaven!  Tulsa is Italy—Please don’t make me go there!\n",
      "Ms. McKenna Chandler, I…\n",
      "Chandler No no no! Look, Carol, can I call you Carol? (Pause) Wh-why would I when your name is Elaine? Oh what a great picture of your son, strapping! (She glares at him.) That’s a picture of your daughter, isn’t it, well she’s lovely. I like a girl with a strong jaw. I’ll call you from Tulsa. (Exits.)\n",

      "Ross I broke my thumb.\n",
      "Joey Your thumb? That’s weird. (Makes a fist.) You sure you’re punching right? Make a fist. (Ross just looks at him with his thumb in a cast.) Maybe later. Ross I feel terrible.\n",
      "Ross You know what, you can go, I just have to fill out some forms. (Tries to hold the pen but can’t)\n",
      "Joey You, you want me to help you with that?\n",
      "Ross Why, does it look like I’m having trouble with my misshapen claw? (He hands Joey the form)\n",
      "Joey Name? (Ross looks at him.) I know Ross but what’s it short for? You know like, like Rossel or Rosstepher.\n",
      "Ross Just Ross!\n",

      "Ross I don’t think that we are.\n",
      "Joey But you two were supposed to be together.\n",
      "Ross Well, I thought so too, but then she said she’d marry you.\n",
      "Joey Come on, Ross, that didn’t mean anything! She just had the baby, she was all freaked out about doing it alone, she would have said yes to anybody.\n",
      "Ross Yeah that’s what she said.\n",
      "Joey So?\n",
      "Ross So I don’t wanna be just anybody.\n",
      "Joey Wow.\n",
      "Ross You know what, it’s, it’s better this way anyway. I mean I don’t know what I was thinking, going down that road again with us. It’s just much easier if we’re just friends who have a kid.\n",
      "Joey Really?\n",
      "Ross Yeah.\n",
      "Joey And you’re Okay with that?\n",
      "Ross Yes. I mean, it’s what we always planned.  And if you have a plan, you should stick to it.  That’s why they call them plans.  Hello? (Pause) I’m fine.\n",
      "Joey Hey, for what it’s worth, with Rachel I don’t think you’ll ever be just (Makes quote marks.) \"anybody.\"\n",
      "Ross Hey there you go! (Smiles because Joey used it correctly)\n",
      "Joey (makes quote marks) \"Thanks.\"\n",
      "Rachel Oh my God! How long has she been crying?\n",
      "Monica About a week and a half.\n",
      "Phoebe Well alright, looks like you guys have got it under control so I’m just gonna go. (She gets up and Rachel looks at her, upset, and Monica just stares.) No! Really? Misery really does love company. All right! (She sits back down.)\n",
      "Monica Rach, try holding her a different way.\n",
      "Rachel You guys, I’m doing the best I can, anyone else is welcome to try.\n",
      "Phoebe Alright, I’ll try, fine! Yes, Okay!\n",
      "Rachel Here you go. (Hands Emma to Phoebe)\n",
      "Phoebe Shh! Nothing works with this child! (Hands her back.)\n",
      "Rachel Oh god what am I gonna do you guys, I can’t even comfort my own baby! I’m the worst mother ever!\n",
      "Monica You’re just new at this, it’ll get better, think about your first day at work. I mean, that couldn’t have been easy but you figured that out.\n",
      "Rachel Yeah I don’t think dressing provocatively is going to help me here! Oh my god just please take her.\n",
      "Monica Okay I’ll take her, here. (Takes Emma)\n",
      "Rachel I have to go to the bathroom. (Goes to the bathroom)\n",

      "Phoebe You must be a fireball in bed.\n",
      "Monica I can’t believe it!  She’s asleep!  I got her to go to sleep!   I have actual magical powers!\n",
      "Phoebe I can hear traffic and birds!  I can hear the voices in my head again! (Monica looks at her strangely) I’m kidding. (She smiles wickedly.)\n",

      "Phoebe Thankfully you don’t need me at all (gets up and to leave) so Okay Super aunt see you later! Rachel let’s give it six to eight months (she leaves).\n",
      "Rachel Okay so listen I’m gonna go lay down.\n",
      "Monica What?\n",
      "Rachel You know the book says that whenever she’s sleeping I should be sleeping so… (She gives Monica thumbs and goes to lay down)\n",

      "Rachel Oh no Ross! This is not good, we have to talk about this Joey thing. Please sit. (He sits) You have got to get over this Joey thing, okay? I never really wanted to marry Joey, okay?\n",
      "Ross Okay.\n",
      "Rachel You know what I really really want?\n",
      "Ross What, Rach?\n",
      "Rachel I wanna sleep, I wanna eat, I wanna take a shower, I mean before she wakes up and we gotta do this all over again.\n",
      "Ross (smiles) Right.\n",
      "Rachel I mean I got news for you mister, Emma?  Not easy.\n",

      "CHANDLER Excuse me, you guys are getting tattoos?\n",
      "RACHEL Yes, but you can not tell Ross 'cause I want to surprise him.\n",
      "JOEY Wow, this is wild. What're you gonna get?\n",
      "PHOEBE Um, I'm getting a lily for my Mom. 'Cause her name's Lily.\n",

      "MONICA No, I don't even know how serious he is about me. Until I do, I'm not telling them anything.\n",
      "ROSS I don't know, I don't think mom and dad would mind. Remember when you were 9 and Richard was 30, how dad used to say, 'God I hope they get together.'\n",
      "ROSS Alright, shall we?\n",
      "MONICA OK, wait, wait, wait, wait. You know what? Ross, let's - let's switch places. You get in the middle. No un-, ya know, unless this looks like we're trying to cover something up.\n",

      "MR. GELLER C'mon, tell us.\n",
      "FRIEND Yeah, is she really 20.\n",
      "RICHARD I am not telling you guys anything.\n",
      "MR. GELLER C'mon Rich, it's my birthday, let me live vicariously.\n",
      "ROSS Dad, you really don't want to do that.\n",
      "MR. GELLER Ahh, what's a little mid-life crisis between friends?\n",
      "RICHARD Jack, would you let it go?\n",
      "MR. GELLER Look, I know what you're going through. When I turned 50 I got the Porsche. You... you got your own little speedster.\n",
      "RICHARD Guys. Seriously, it is not like that.\n",
      "MR. GELLER Tell you what, maybe one of these weekends you can borrow the car and I cou. . .\n",

      "RACHEL Well I. . .\n",
      "PHOEBE I like this lily. It's more open, ya know, and that's like my mom. She had a more open, giving spirit. Ooh, Foghorn Leghorn, ooh.\n",

      "PHOEBE What? Is it - is this 'cause of what Ross said?\n",
      "RACHEL No. Well, yeah, maybe.\n",
      "PHOEBE I don't believe this. Is this how this relationship's gonna work? Ross equals boss. I mean, c'mon what is this, 1922?\n",
      "RACHEL What's 1922?\n",
      "PHOEBE Just, you know, long time ago. Well, when men used to tell women what to do - a lot. And then there was suffrage, which is a good thing but is sounds horrible. Do you want to get this tattoo?\n",
      "RACHEL Yes I do, it's just that Ross is. . .\n",

      "MRS. GELLER Really.\n",
      "MR. GELLER I tell you, I've never seen him this happy.\n",
      "MRS. GELLER So Jack, you ever think about trading me in for a younger model?\n",
      "MR. GELLER Of course not. With you it's like I've got two 25-year-olds.\n",

      "RACHEL But what about Phoebe?\n",
      "TERRY Rachel, it's not that your friend is bad, it's that she's so bad, she makes me want to put my finger through my eye into my brain and swirl it around.\n",
      "RACHEL Ok, ok, so you're not a fan, but I mean, come on, you cannot do this to her.\n",
      "TERRY Uh--\n",

      "CHANDLER You know, I don't think we brought enough stuff. Did you forget to pack the baby's anvil?\n",
      "JOEY It's gonna be worth it. It's a known fact that women love babies, all righ? Women love guys who love babies. It's that whole sensitive thing. Quick, aim him at that pack o' babes over there. Maybe one of them will break away. No, no wait, for get them, we got one, hard left. All right, gimme the baby.\n",

      "RACHEL Honey, I'm sorry.\n",
      "PHOEBE And he's going to be paying this woman? Why doesn't he just give her like a throne, and a crown, and like a, you know, gold stick with a ball on top.\n",
      "RACHEL Terry is a jerk, ok? That's why we're always saying \"Terry's a jerk!\" That's where that came from.\n",

      "RACHEL What?\n",
      "PHOEBE Well you said that he's paying the people who are playing.\n",

      "RACHEL Well, but Pheebs.\n",
      "PHOEBE No, huh uh, I'm sorry, no. No, I'm not some like sloppy second, charity band. You know what, there are thousands of places in this city where people would be happy to pay to hear me play. (Out on the sidewalk, singing) When I play, I play for me, I don't need your charity. (Someone puts a coin in her guitar case) Thank you! La la la la la la la....\n",

      "ROSS Tho?\n",
      "ROSS Ohhh.\n",
      "MONICA That's good, have a seat. Um, the doctor says it's gotta be a needle. You're just gonna have to be brave, ok? Can you do that for me?\n",

      "JOEY Hi, here's the deal. We lost a carseat on a bus today. It's white plastic, with a handle, and it fits onto a stroller. Oh, and there was a baby in it. He wants to talk to you again.\n",

      "RACHEL Do you?\n",
      "PHOEBE No. This whole like playing-for-money thing is so not good for me. You know, I don't know, when I sang \"Su-Su-Suicide\", I got a dollar seventy-five. But then, \"Smelly Cat\", I got 25 cents and a condom. So you know, now I just feel really bad for Smelly Cat.\n",
      "RACHEL Well, you know, honey, I don't think everybody gets Smelly Cat. You know, I mean, if all you've ever actually had are healthy pets, then, whoosh!\n",

      "All Hey\n",
      "Ross Wow, Monica’s letting other people help decorate her tree! Did someone get her drunk again or?\n",

      "Monica Oh, here.\n",
      "Chandler See now it feels like Christmas!\n",
      "Ross … and that’s the story of the dreidle. Now, some people trace the Christmas tree back to the Egyptians, who used to bring green palm branches into their huts on the shortest day of the year, symbolising life’s triumph over death. And that was like 4000 years ago.\n",
      "Rachel So, pretty much around the same time that you started telling this story.\n",
      "Joey Hey you guys.\n",
      "Chandler Hey Joe what’s up?\n",
      "Joey I had to get out of the apartment. Janine is like stretching all over the place. Y’know, everywhere I look she’s like… (He imitates her stretching)\n",
      "Chandler I can see why that’s hard to resist.\n",
      "Joey I like her so much!\n",
      "Monica Aw, I’m sorry sweetie that she doesn’t feel the same way.\n",
      "Joey I know. And she’s so sweet. I just wanna feed her grapes and brush her hair.\n",
      "Chandler You are aware that she’s not a monkey, right?\n",

      "Ross Are you serious?\n",
      "Monica We are there!\n",

      "Monica What are you talking about? She just invited him to the biggest party of the millennium!\n",
      "Rachel Yeah, but she also invited you and Ross. Yeah, honey, I’m sorry, but I don’t think that was a romantic thing.\n",
      "Joey Oh. Maybe. But hey I know how I can find out. We’re going to a New Year’s Eve party, right? So at midnight, I can kiss her. And if she kisses me back, great! Y’know? But if she says ‘Dude, what the hell are you doing?’ I can say ‘It wasn’t me, it was New Years!’\n",
      "Rachel Well, that’s a lot better than Ross trying to kiss me in High School, and saying that he did it because he needed chapstick.\n",

      "Phoebe Oh, that’s it? (Mimics Chandler) A great idea!\n",
      "Rachel Chandler, that’s not enough. I mean what if she gets you a great present, two medium presents, and a bunch of little presents? And you’ve just gotten her one great present? I mean that’s just gonna make her feel bad. Why would you do that to her Chandler? Why? Why?\n",
      "Chandler If I help, we can find ‘em faster!\n",

      "Chandler You don’t, like go into the back of my closet, and look under my gym bag or anything?\n",
      "Phoebe and Rachel No, we never do that\n",

      "Ross Right.\n",
      "Ross Hey, what’d you guys do to get up on there?\n",
      "Girl We learned how to dance.\n",

      "Director I don’t see it. (To Janine) You are dancing with the tall guy over there. Tall guy, raise your hand! (He does. Janine goes over to him.)\n",
      "Joey No-no hey buddy, please let me dance with that girl, I really like her and I think I have a shot.\n",
      "Director Really, y’think so? I don’t..\n",
      "Chandler I couldn't find anything at Joey--Hey-hey, oh hey!\n",
      "Rachel Yeah, we found them. There were in the guest room closet behind some coats.\n",
      "Phoebe Yeah, and you have nothing to worry about 'cos they're all crap!\n",

      "Rachel Yes, okay, oh, by the way, I just gotta say, I think it's really nice of you that even after you've moved, you still keep storing that stuff for Joey!\n",
      "Joey Hey-hey dancer girl! Can I go to the bathroom? I just.. (The girl starts dancing really close to him, so he picks her up, twirls her round, and puts her against a platform) Here we go. (He walks away to find Monica and Ross doing a really out of place dance) Looking good Gellers!\n",
      "Ross We know!\n",
      "Monica Hey, see that snippy guy over there? He’s the one who decides who gets up on the platform. We should go dance by him.\n",
      "Ross Okay.\n",
      "Director Okay, everybody hold!\n",
      "Director Next on the platforms are… (He points to the right of Ross and Monica, so they dance over to where he’s pointing to. He points away from them) …you two! And… (He points the other way, and Ross and Monica follow his arm. Again he points away.) …You two!\n",
      "Monica Excuse me, sir, would it help if I weren’t wearing underpants?\n",
      "Ross Monica! (Pause) Would it?\n",
      "Joey Hey! Tall guy! Hey, listen, I wanted to talk to you about that girl that you’re dancing with.\n",
      "Tall Guy She’s nice, huh? To think I almost brought my wife to this!\n",
      "Joey Yeah, yeah, okay. Uh, look buddy, I came with that girl, and I had this plan to kiss her at the new years countdown – I’m trying to win her over, so I was wondering if..\n",
      "Tall Guy No I don’t think so.\n",
      "Joey Oh come on man, you can dance with my partner, she’s real, uh, mellow!\n",
      "Tall Guy Look, are you dating this girl you came with?\n",
      "Joey Well, I was hoping after tonight that maybe I could you know…\n",
      "Tall Guy No, no. She’s fair game if you ask me, sorry buddy!\n",
      "Joey Alright, alright, hey y’know fair is fair, (he pretends to wash his hands) if you’re right, you’re right, what can I say, but hey oh no! (He throws water on the guy’s pants)\n",
      "Tall Guy God! What are you, in second grade?\n",
      "Joey Hey, now you’re the one who wet his pants. (He throws another handful on him and runs out)\n",
      "Monica Man, this sucks! Y’know if Mom and Dad don’t see us on TV after we made them so jealous, I mean, who’s gonna be the losers then?\n",
      "Ross Hey, I know what’ll get us up on a platform!\n",
      "Monica What?\n",
      "Ross The routine!\n",
      "Monica Ross, we haven’t done the routine since middle school.\n",
      "Ross Hey, when the snippy guy sees the routine, he’ll wanna build us our own platform!\n",
      "Monica Was it really that good?\n",
      "Ross We got honourable mention in the brother/sister dance category! Look, it’s almost fake midnight, do we really have any other choice?\n",
      "Monica Okay, let’s do it. Mom and Dad are gonna be so faced!\n",
      "Monica 5 6 7 8!\n",
      "Ross So, do we really have to ask who’s going up on the platform next?\n",
      "Director Oh no! You get up there and do that again exactly like that!\n",
      "Monica Yes! (They run over to a platform)\n",
      "Director (To Cameraman) Make sure you get this, they’re gonna want it for the bloopers show. (To everyone) Alright cut! Listen up everyone, when we start again it’s gonna be the countdown to new years, so I wanna see everybody’s excitement.\n",
      "Tall Guy Hey, pal, you have about three seconds to get away from my partner.\n",
      "Director What’s going on over here?\n",
      "Joey Uh, take a look at the guy’s pants! I mean, I know you told us to show excitement, but don’t you think he went a little overboard?\n",
      "Director What’s the matter with you? Get out of here!\n",
      "Joey Yeah, take a hike wetpants!\n",
      "Ross Can you believe this? We’re gonna be on the platform for the Millennium moment!\n",
      "Monica I know! Hey, you haven’t been practising the routine, have you?\n",
      "Ross No!\n",
      "Monica Me too!\n",
      "Ross Hey, when the music starts up again, I was thinking of maybe goind into the robot, y’know? (He mimics a robot)\n",
      "Monica Ross, I think we should stick to the routine, we don’t wanna look stupid!\n",
      "Director Alright we’re back! Ten seconds left here we go! Ten! Nine! Eight! Seven! (He continues to count as we hear Joey think)\n",

      "Chandler Oh, hey guys!\n",
      "Phoebe Y’know, birds have a very good sense of direction, and I thought maybe they could help us find where the presents are hidden.\n",
      "Chandler Yes, if the presents are hidden south for the winter.\n",
      "Phoebe Or we could just follow your clever jokes – any ideas? No! Didn’t think so! Okay, c’mon guys, show us where the presents are!\n",
      "Chandler Oh, the duck seems to think that Monica got me garbage! Hmm, I wonder what I could get Monica that’s as good as garbage?\n",

      "Phoebe But Monica, he loves his job so much! Can you just give him another chance? Please?\n",

      "Phoebe Okay. Okay, but you can’t fire him today.\n",
      "Monica Why not?!\n",
      "Phoebe Because I’m dumping him today.\n",
      "Monica What?! You said he was sweet!\n",
      "Phoebe He is sweet. He’s too sweet. He calls me all the time. (Mimicking him) \"So did-did you get home from work okay?\" \"Did-did you get out of the shower okay?\"\n",

      "Phoebe Then he comes over! (Mimicking him) \"I’m so worried about you.\" Uck! Be a man!\n",
      "Monica What? So now I’m not allowed to fire him?\n",
      "Phoebe You can’t fire him and dump him the same day, he’ll kill himself.\n",
      "Monica Okay well then, I’ll fire him today and you go out with him for another week.\n",
      "Phoebe Are you kidding?! Another week with that sip, I’ll kill myself!\n",
      "Monica Okay well, then we’ll both do it today and he’ll just have to deal with it!\n",
      "Phoebe Okay. But the question is who’s gonna go first. ‘Cause whoever goes second is the bitch.\n",
      "Monica What do you mean?\n",
      "Phoebe Come on! The boss that fires a guy that’s just been dumped, bitch! And the woman who dumps a guy that’s just been fired, blond bitch!\n",
      "Monica I wanted to do this days ago so I think I should go first.\n",

      "Rachel Hey, what do you think is a better excuse for why I’m not drinking on this date tonight. \"Umm, I’m a recovering alcoholic. I’m a Mormon,\" or \"I got so hammered last night I’m still a little drunk?\"\n",

      "Joey No\n",
      "Ross Joey what-what were you thinking?!\n",
      "Joey Well, I was thinking that it’d probably be okay because Ross hasn’t gone out with Rachel in five years!\n",
      "Ross Joey, I’m not worried about her! I’m worried about my baby! Whoever she dates my baby dates! Now-now where is this (makes the quote-marks sign) actor taking them?\n",
      "Joey Hey! I’m an (does the quote-marks thing as well) actor too! I’m not sure. I think they’re taking the ferry out to some Italian place on Staten Island.\n",
      "Ross A ferry? My baby is going on a ferry? Do you have any idea how dangerous those are?!\n",
      "Joey Are we talking about one of those big boats that carry cars that go like five miles an hour?\n",
      "Ross Why don’t they just jump out of an airplane?! Huh?! That-that’s a fun date! Or burn each other with matches?! That’s fun too! Whew!!\n",
      "Kash Hey Joey.\n",
      "Joey Hey Kash. Uh hey-hey this is Ross. Ross, this is Kash.\n",
      "Kash Hey.\n",
      "Ross Hi. I-I hear you’re going on a ferry tonight.\n",
      "Kash Yeah.\n",
      "Ross A bit of a daredevil are we?\n",
      "Rachel (entering from her room) Hey guys do you think this is too slutty—Hi Kash!\n",
      "Kash Hey Rachel! You ready to go?\n",
      "Rachel Yeah! All right, I’ll see you guys later.\n",
      "Ross Okay. Have a great time you guys.\n",
      "Rachel Thank you.\n",
      "Kash Thank you.\n",
      "Ross Yes it is too slutty! (Joey slams the door before Rachel could hear the entire sentence.)\n",
      "Tim (walks behind Phoebe) Hi! (And startles her.)\n",
      "Phoebe Hi.\n",
      "Tim Oh, I’m so glad you called. I feel like it’s always me calling you. So, what’s up? Is everything okay with Phoebe?\n",
      "Phoebe It will be…in a minute. Listen, Tim you’re a really great guy.\n",
      "Tim It’s because I’m with you.\n",
      "Phoebe Aw. (Phoebe gets a bad taste in her mouth when he looks away) I’m just—I’m in a place in my life right now where I…I…\n",
      "Tim Whoops. Sorry. (Looking at it, like a newscaster) This just in. (Phoebe fake laughs.) Oh, it’s 9-1-1 from the restaurant, that means Monica needs me right away. (Starts to leave.)\n",
      "Phoebe Oh-oh no she doesn’t! I know what that is. You can stay.\n",
      "Tim Awww, I’ll miss you too Pheebs. (Starts to leave) And I will be holding you, right here. (Holds his hands over his heart, blows a kiss to Phoebe who catches it, and then leaves and Phoebe throws the kiss back.)\n",
      "Joey So what movie do you want to see—And not another one I have to read. Okay? I get enough of that from books.\n",
      "Ross Books?\n",
      "Joey All right, car magazines, cereal boxes, but it’s like enough!\n",
      "Ross Well, I tell you what. Why don’t we uh, why don’t we just stay here? Let’s not see a movie, we’ll just hang.\n",
      "Joey And just wait for Rachel to come back from her date?\n",
      "Ross Hey, if that’s what you want to do I’m not gonna say no.\n",
      "Joey Dude! What is going on?!\n",
      "Ross I just…I have to find out how it went.\n",
      "Joey Why?\n",
      "Ross This guy could be my baby’s stepfather!\n",
      "Joey They go on one date and you’re worried about them getting married?! He’s not you!\n",
      "Ross I just—I-I can’t believe she’s-she’s dating?!\n",
      "Joey Well Ross, what did you think she was gonna do?\n",
      "Ross I don’t know! I guess I just can’t believe any of this is happening.\n",
      "Joey What do you mean?\n",
      "Ross It’s just I always thought when I had another kid it would be different. Now I-I love Ben, but every time I have to drop him off at Carol and Susan’s, it’s like—It breaks my heart a little. I mean I’ve always had this picture of me and my next wife in bed on Sunday and, my kid comes running in and leaps up onto the bed. And we all read the paper together. Y’know? Maybe fight over the science section.\n",
      "Joey That’s a nice picture. Maybe you can still have that!\n",
      "Ross No! No I can’t. I mean Rachel’s out with some guy. My baby went with her. If anything that picture keeps moving further away.\n",
      "Joey Hey, can I ask you something? In this, in this picture of you and your wife, is your wife Rachel?\n",
      "Ross It used to be. Now she doesn’t really have a face. Smokin’ body though.\n",
      "Joey Good call. Yeah. But, the face Ross, the face isn’t Rachel.\n",
      "Ross No but ahh! How much easier would it be if it were?\n",
      "Joey I know, but I don’t think that’s what she wants.\n",
      "Ross No, it’s not what I want either. I mean I-I can’t force myself to fall in love with her again now.\n",
      "Joey That’s okay Ross maybe you need a new picture. Okay? It’s not gonna be what you thought, but no matter what there’s gonna be a brand new little baby, your baby. Who cares what the picture looks like?\n",
      "Ross Yeah.\n",
      "Joey Hey, I tell you what. Let’s you and me go out and have some fun. Huh? Whatever you want. Come on!\n",
      "Ross (checks his watch) We can still catch that Ukrainian film.\n",
      "Joey No, I said fun!\n",
      "Bob Hey Toby!\n",
      "Chandler Hey Bobby.\n",
      "Bob It’s Bob actually. Hey, you work up here, can you tell me where this Chandler Bing’s office is?\n",
      "Chandler Uhh yeah. Yeah, it’s (Points down the hall) right, right down there. (When he has Bob looking down the hall, he turns around and knocks his nameplate off of his door.) Right there, yeah. Can I ask you why?\n",
      "Bob I want to talk to that bastard, see what his problem is.\n",
      "Chandler Okay Bob listen uhh, I’m the reason you didn’t get the job up here.\n",
      "Bob Toby don’t.\n",
      "Chandler Bob!\n",
      "Bob Toby! I’m not gonna let you cover for him. Anything you say right now will just get me more upset with Chandler!\n",
      "Chandler Well that puts me in a difficult position.\n",
      "Monica Hey.\n",
      "Tim I got your page, is everything okay?\n",
      "Monica Uh well that depends, how are things with Phoebe?\n",
      "Tim Oh it’s great! It’s great! Thank you so much for introducing us!\n",
      "Monica Oh my pleasure. Okay, I’m afraid I’ve got some bad news. (Phoebe enters.) Phoebe!\n",
      "Phoebe Monica!\n",
      "Monica (simultaneously) You’re fired!\n",
      "Phoebe (simultaneously) I’m breaking up with you!\n",
      "Tim What?\n",
      "Phoebe I’m, I’m breaking up with you.\n",
      "Monica You’re fired.\n",
      "Tim Why?\n",
      "Phoebe I’m sorry, I’m just—I’m…I’m just not ready for a relationship right now.\n",
      "Monica Yeah and-and I’m sorry too. But, well I just—I like things done a certain way and the chemistry’s just not right.\n",
      "Phoebe Oh that’s good, the chemistry thing for us too.\n",
      "Tim Wow! Umm, okay. Umm… (To Phoebe) I-I-I realize I came on a little strong but, it’s only because I think you’re so amazing. (To Monica) And uh, I-I just wanna, I just wanna tell you how much I appreciate you giving me an opportunity here because I—you’re the most talented chef I’ve ever worked for. Anyway… (Starts to leave and Phoebe and Monica trade looks.)\n",
      "Monica Tim wait!\n",
      "Tim Yeah?\n",
      "Monica Umm, I think I spoke too quickly. There-there’s a learning curve with this job and maybe we can try it again.\n",
      "Tim Really?\n",
      "Monica Yeah.\n",
      "Tim Thank you so much! ‘Cause I-I know I can do better!\n",
      "Monica Okay.\n",
      "Phoebe And Tim I just wanna say, good luck here. (Shakes his hand and leaves, which disgusts Monica.)\n",
      "Ross Hello.\n",
      "Rachel Hi!\n",
      "Ross Well, how was the date?\n",
      "Rachel Well I’m alone and I just bought fifteen dollars worth of candy bars, what do you think?\n",
      "Ross Uh-huh. What happened?\n",
      "Rachel I made the mistake of telling him that I was pregnant.\n",
      "Ross Ah, he didn’t uh, take it so well?\n",
      "Rachel Well better than you, but y’know still not what you want.\n",
      "Ross Oh?\n",
      "Rachel He got all weird and sputtery and then he said uh, \"Yeah, I hear those hemorrhoids are a bitch.\"\n",
      "Ross He sounds swell.\n",
      "Rachel Doesn’t he?\n",
      "Ross Hey, wanna…wanna a little cheering up?\n",
      "Rachel Yes.\n",
      "Ross Sit down.\n",
      "Rachel Okay.\n",
      "Ross Guess whose middle name is Muriel.\n",
      "Rachel (thinks then gasps) Chandler M. Bing?\n",
      "Ross Yeah-ha!\n",
      "Rachel Oh my God. (Laughs)\n",
      "Ross I’m sorry about your date.\n",
      "Rachel Oh it’s all right. I’m guess I’m just done with the whole dating thing. It’s one more thing in my life that’s suddenly completely different. This is hard.\n",
      "Ross Yeah I know. (Pause) On the other hand in um, in about seven months you’re gonna have something that you’re gonna love more than any guy you’ve ever gone out with. Just wait. Wait until uh, wait until the first time your baby grabs your finger. You have no idea.\n",
      "Rachel Thanks sweetie.\n",
      "Ross You wanna, you wanna grab some coffee?\n",
      "Rachel Oh no, I think I’m gonna go home and eat ten candy bars.\n",
      "Ross Hey, I thought I cheered you up.\n",
      "Rachel Oh you did, there are twenty in here.\n",
      "Ross Right. Good night.\n",
      "Rachel Good night.\n",
      "Mona Ross?\n",
      "Ross Yeah?\n",
      "Mona Hey it’s Mona! From the wedding.\n",
      "Ross Oh hi!\n",
      "Mona Hi!\n",
      "Ross Wow! Uh…how are you?\n",
      "Mona I’m good except umm, you still owe me a dance.\n",
      "Ross Oh that’s right. Well uh, would you be interested in seeing a Ukrainian film?\n",
      "Mona (laughs then stops) Oh you’re serious. Sure!\n",
      "Ross Great! Well umm…\n",
      "Mona I think I might need one more cup of coffee.\n",
      "Ross Sure! Uh, let me get it for ya.\n",
      "Mona Okay.\n",
      "Chandler (entering) Bob. Bob! Bob!!! (He turns around) What the hell are you doing?!\n",
      "Bob I just found out this is Chandler’s office! Come on Toby, give me a hand!\n",

      "Rachel It’s good. Except he makes us watch the Discovery Channel all day long. Did you know that something really boring happened to someone really ugly in the Middle Ages? (to the waitress handing her a cup of coffee) Oh, thank you. I’ll see you guys later.\n",
      "Phoebe Okay.\n",
      "Joey Bye.\n",
      "Joey There’s one lucky to-go cup of coffee.\n",
      "Phoebe (sighs) Honey, I wish you would get over her. I hate seeing you like this. Is there anything I can do for you? Do you want to look down my top?\n",
      "Joey Thanks. But maybe later.\n",
      "Phoebe Oh, Gunther, can I get a scone?\n",
      "Gunther (to Joey) You want anything?\n",
      "Joey You know what I want? I want a lot of things! I want to be with the woman I love on Valentine’s Day! And I want her to love me back! And I want just one moment of relief from the gut-wrenching pain of knowing that that’s never going to happen!\n",
      "Gunther We have red bagels.\n",
      "Joey Oh, okay.\n",
      "Phoebe So, how does Mona feel about you and Rachel living together?\n",
      "Ross Oh, I’m actually on my way to tell her right now. Yeah, she’s been away all week visiting her parents, but she’ll be cool. I mean, she’s been so supportive. She-she even got the baby a tiny T-shirt that says, ‘Fossils are my friends.’\n",
      "Phoebe Ugh. Come on, Mona, don’t kiss ass.\n",
      "Ross Uh, I’m going to take off.\n",
      "Phoebe All right. Oh! Shoot! Oh shoot! Uh, Rachel wanted to see this tape!\n",
      "Ross What is it?\n",
      "Phoebe It’s a video of my friend giving birth. Could you just bring it back to your apartment?\n",
      "Ross All right. (reading the label) ‘Candy and Cookie?’\n",
      "Phoebe Yeah. Candy’s the mother, Cookie’s the daughter. The father’s also Cookie. Why am I friends with these people?\n",
      "Monica (entering with something behind her back) Phoebe, c’mere. I want to show you something in the bathroom.\n",
      "Phoebe Oh, Monica, grow up!\n",
      "Ross Hey, what’s behind your back?\n",
      "Monica Nothing. Just something I want to get Phoebe’s opinion on for Valentine’s Day.\n",
      "Ross You don’t want my opinion?\n",
      "Monica Not really.\n",
      "Ross Come on, I’m your older brother, ask me!\n",
      "Monica All right, big brother. (holds up two erm…revealing articles of clothing) Which of these do you think would make your little sister look hotter, so your best friend would want to do her?\n",
      "Ross (quietly) The red one.\n",
      "Phoebe (knocking and entering) Hey. Look, I know you’ve been really depressed lately, so I brought someone over to cheer you up. Right outside this door is a real, live, furry playmate.\n",

      "Phoebe He-hee!\n",
      "Joey Hey! A dog! Hi! Who, you got to admit, looks a lot like Jane.\n",
      "Phoebe This is the happiest dog in the world. I borrowed him from my friend Wendy. Now, you can only keep him until he cheers you up. And he will cheer you up!\n",
      "Joey Thanks so much, Pheebs! (to the dog) We are going to have so much fun, yes we are! (the dog sticks his head between Joey’s legs) Oh! Not that kind of fun.\n",
      "Chandler Happy Valentine’s!\n",
      "Monica (from her bedroom) Okay! I’ll be right out. I’m slipping into something a little less comfortable, and a little more slutty.\n",
      "Chandler (picking up a video from the table) ‘Candy and Cookie’. ‘Candy and Cookie?’ Monica got me porn?! Girl-on-girl porn?! She really must love me!! (Chandler runs over to the TV, puts the tape in, and sits down to enjoy some \"porn\")\n",
      "Man on TV Yeah, just relax.\n",
      "Chandler I love you, St. Valentine.\n",
      "Chandler Woah, woah, that’s not pretty!\n",
      "Man on TV Now, push!\n",

      "Joey Get the ball, ready? Get the ball, get the ball! (Joey pretends to throw it, but really doesn’t, and the dog goes running off.) Well, you’re cute, but you’re not too smart!\n",
      "Joey (looking at the ball the dog brought back) Did I just throw this?\n",

      "Joey Hi.\n",
      "Rachel I accidentally packed these with my stuff. (looks at the dog and gasps) Who is this?\n",

      "Rachel (talking with a higher voice, and puckered lips…kind of like you do to a baby or...well…a puppy…it’s hard to explain. Just use your imagination!) Oh, well, you are so cute! I wish I could play with you more, but I’ve got to go to work! I hope I stop talking like this before my marketing meeting, yes I do. Yes I do. (still talking like that) Bye-bye, Joey. Oh, I seriously can’t stop it. (exits)\n",
      "Joey (to the dog) C’mere. Hey. C’mere. That’s Rachel. She’s the one who used to live here. Might as well be honest with you—we love her. But we can’t have her. I really miss her. Well, hey, you understand, right? You’re a guy. (thinks about it and picks up the dog and looks) Well, you used to be.\n",

      "Monica What is it?\n",

      "Monica Is this the video of the baby being born? Sweetie, this is Phoebe’s. Why were you even watching it?\n",
      "Chandler I thought…maybe…you got me porn for Valentine’s Day.\n",
      "Monica Chandler, if you thought I was going to get you porn for Valentine’s Day… (pulls a video out of a basket) you were right! Apparently, it’s about a young girl who moves to the big city, you know, in search of stardom, but ends up having sex with a lot of guys! Yeah, it got four starts! (looks closer) Oh, wait a minute. Those aren’t stars. Anyway, you want to take a look?\n",
      "Chandler Well, I’m not really in a sexy mood right now.\n",
      "Monica Honey, what’s going on?\n",

      "Monica Mm-hmm.\n",

      "Monica Chandler, we can’t let this tape wreck Valentine’s Day!\n",
      "Chandler You don’t know. You didn’t see it.\n",
      "Monica Child-birth, it’s a natural thing! It’s beautiful.\n",
      "Chandler Oh, beautiful? Really? Beautiful? You think this is beautiful? (picks up the remote and presses a button, and he immediately makes a face that just looks like he’s going to throw up!)\n",
      "Monica Oh! Oh, my God! No wonder my mother hates me!\n",
      "Chandler See, honey, there’s—(puts his hand on her leg)\n",
      "Monica Don’t touch me!\n",
      "Mona Hi!\n",

      "Ross Yeah?\n",
      "Mona I brought you back a present.\n",
      "Ross Wha—? Oh, come on. You didn’t have to—saltwater taffy?! (Mona laughs) Thanks! This is interesting. You know, most people think this is made with sea water, but it’s actually made with, uh, salted fresh water. That’s not interesting.\n",
      "Mona I think it’s interesting.\n",
      "Ross I do too! I missed you!\n",
      "Mona I missed you, too! So, how was your week?\n",
      "Ross Oh, it was good! It was good. Actually, the baby started kicking!\n",
      "Mona How exciting!\n",
      "Ross Yeah! I know! It was. Oh… the only sad thing is I wasn’t around when it happened for the first time.\n",
      "Mona Oh no.\n",
      "Ross Yeah, I’m missing out on all this other stuff, too. So, Joey suggested Rachel move in with me.\n",
      "Mona (laughing) Yeah right!\n",
      "Ross What?\n",
      "Mona Joey cracks me up! It’s like, ‘Yeah, why don’t you have your ex-wife move in with you? That wouldn’t be awkward at all!’ (she laughs again)\n",
      "Ross (not amused) Huh…uh-huh.\n",
      "Mona Huh, could you imagine. I go away for a few days, and come back, and my boyfriend is living with some woman he got pregnant! (Mona laughs…yes…again!)\n",
      "Mona So, what’d you tell him?\n",
      "Ross (with his mouth full) Just a second! (he fake laughs, but turns his head and starts to break down)\n",
      "Phoebe How could you not tell Mona that Rachel is living with you?\n",
      "Ross I don’t know, she seemed to think it was such a crazy idea! Um, plus, she, uh, she got me taffy!\n",
      "Phoebe Taffy, really? I’ve never had any.\n",
      "Ross Ever?!\n",
      "Phoebe Well, I think my mother was too busy planning her suicide to provide saltwater treats. (Ross hands her one) Thank you! So what, you’re just never going to tell her?\n",
      "Ross Oh, no, no, no, I will! I just want to butter her up, first! You know, I’m going to take her to an amazing Valentine’s dinner. Do all this romantic stuff, and then, just when she thinks I’m the best boyfriend in the world, then I’m going to tell her that my pregnant ex-girlfriend is living with me.\n",
      "Phoebe If I haven’t said it before: she’s a lucky, lucky lady! So, where are you going to—what the mother of crap is up with this stuff? (Referring to the taffy, which she’s been chewing this whole time.) Oh, God. Is it gum, is it food? What’s the deal? (she swallows it, finally) Oh, it’s nice! May I try a pink one?\n",
      "Joey So, between her and me being friends, and her history with Ross, it just isn’t going to happen. It would be like you falling in love with a cat.\n",
      "Phoebe (entering) Hey!\n",
      "Joey Hey.\n",
      "Phoebe Hey, buddy. How’s my favorite dog, huh? How’s my favorite dog? (the dog doesn’t move) You’re subdued. (to Joey) Did you give him a beer?\n",
      "Joey No.\n",
      "Phoebe Will you excuse us, we need to talk for a moment.\n",
      "Joey Yeah, sure. Go ahead. (pause) Oh, me, right!\n",
      "Phoebe He’s miserable! What happened to him?\n",
      "Joey Nothing. We just talked about stuff.\n",
      "Phoebe What stuff?\n",
      "Joey Rachel stuff.\n",
      "Phoebe Oh…Joey, you bummed him out! This was the happiest dog in the world, and he spends half a day with you, and look at him!\n",
      "Joey He’s breathing!\n",
      "Phoebe Okay, I’m going to take him back to Wendy’s.\n",
      "Joey No, no, no, no! He’s fine! Look, look, look! (picks up the ball) Here’s your ball! Get your ball! Get your ball! (he throws the ball and it bounces right next to the dog) Get your ball! My God, what have I done to you, huh? I broke the dog! Pheebs, I broke the dog!\n",
      "Ross Well, I’m, uh, going to pick up Mona. What have you got going tonight?\n",
      "Rachel Oh, I’ve got big Valentine’s plans! I’ve got my Chinese food on the way, and the rest of your saltwater taffy!\n",
      "Ross Y’know, it’s interesting! Most people think that’s made with seawater, when in fact—\n",
      "Rachel Ross, we actually watched the documentary together.\n",
      "Rachel Ooh! My Chinese food! Let me get my cash! (runs to her room to get her money)\n",
      "Ross (opening the door to see Mona standing there) Mona? What are—hi! What are you doing here? I’m, um, supposed to pick you up!\n",
      "Mona Change of plans, I made you a special Valentine’s dinner! Surprise!\n",
      "Ross (he makes some really weird noise hear that sounds kind of like…)Ayyyayyyy!\n",
      "Rachel (entering) Oh, hey, Mona!\n",
      "Mona Hi! Hi. Hi, Rachel! (to Ross) What’s she doing here?\n",
      "Ross I have no idea!\n",
      "Rachel I’ll be watching TV if anybody needs me. (exits to her room)\n",
      "Mona Seriously, what is she doing?\n",
      "Ross Uh…lately, she just likes hanging out here.\n",
      "Mona Why?\n",
      "Ross I think she’s lonely.\n",
      "Mona Okay, but it’s Valentine’s Day!\n",
      "Ross I know.\n",

      "Ross No, no. She’s way to emotional. And by emotional I mean crazy.\n",
      "Rachel I’m not here! That’s just my Chinese food!\n",
      "Mona Oh, my God! She has food delivered here?\n",
      "Ross Mm-hmm. She’s—she’s emotional, but, but ballsy.\n",
      "Rachel You know what I’m going to do? I’m going to get in my sweats, and eat this in bed! (exits)\n",
      "Ross And you thought she was going to be in our way! So, why don’t you, uh, open the champagne, and I’ll be right back. I’ve got a surprise for you.\n",
      "Mona You got another ex-wife back there?\n",
      "Ross (fakes a laugh) Please start drinking! (exits)\n",
      "Rachel (entering) I’m just going to grab the phone.\n",
      "Mona Oh, Rachel! Wait! Hey, I hope you don’t take this the wrong way, but, but, um… what are you doing?\n",
      "Rachel Oh, I’m sorry! Do you need the phone?\n",
      "Mona No, no. Listen, Ross is too nice to say anything, but this is his apartment, and, and, we gotta have some boundaries, so why don’t you go back to your place and give us some privacy?\n",
      "Rachel (as Ross enters with a present) But, but, Mona, I live here.\n",
      "Ross (handing Mona the present) Happy Valentine’s Day! …Or something to remember me by.\n",
      "Monica How long has it been this time?\n",
      "Chandler 90 seconds.\n",
      "Monica That’s better. 90 seconds is a long time not to think about it…except all I did was think about it.\n",
      "Chandler You know, it haunts me? Up ‘til now, the worst thing I ever saw, was my father doing tequila shots off the naked houseboy. After this, I would gladly make that my screensaver!\n",
      "Monica Okay, well, we have to get past this! Why don’t we get rid of the tape and pretend it never existed?\n",
      "Chandler I can do that.\n",
      "Monica Okay.\n",
      "Chandler Okay. Now all we’ve got to do is get rid of this chair.\n",
      "Monica Oh, thank God!\n",
      "Chandler Oh, I know!\n",
      "Monica Come in!\n",
      "Rachel (entering) Hi! I’m so sorry to barge in on your Valentine’s, but I had to get away from all the yelling. Mona is dumping Ross.\n",
      "Monica Oh, my God.\n",
      "Chandler Poor Ross.\n",
      "Chandler Oh, great. We have to watch him do yoga in his underwear, but for this he closes the drapes!\n",
      "Monica Rach, you know that birthing tape you wanted to see? It’s here.\n",
      "Chandler Oh, and we should warn you, before you watch it: don’t watch it.\n",
      "Rachel Why? You saw it? Is it scary?\n",
      "Chandler Well, let’s just say it’s ironic how footage of someone being born can make you want to kill yourself.\n",
      "Rachel Well, now, wait. Now I’m all freaked out. Come on, you guys will watch it with me.\n",
      "Monica No, but I will leave a sweater that smells like me right next to you!\n",
      "Rachel C’mon, seriously, you guys, you’re not going to make me watch this alone!\n",
      "Monica She’s right…of course not. Honey, get the tape.\n",
      "Chandler (with his arm all the way under the cushion, moving it around) This reminds me of a very specific part of the tape. (Chandler puts the tape in, and they all sit down) Okay, here we go.\n",
      "Rachel Okay. (watching the tape) Ooh, my! (Rachel jumps when the woman starts screaming) Woah! Why is that baby torturing that woman?!\n",
      "Chandler Why have I seen this thing three times?!\n",
      "Monica It’s…still beautiful.\n",
      "Rachel Uh! It’s horrible!\n",
      "Monica I know! I know, I’m so sorry for you!\n",
      "Rachel Oh, my God!\n",
      "Chandler Wait, you guys, look!\n",
      "Rachel What? Did her ass explode?!\n",
      "Chandler No, the baby’s out! Look, look!\n",

I gave her a key to my apartment, and then had the locks changed! And then I lied to her about Rachel moving in with me. In a way, I actually judge her for not breaking up with me sooner, you know?\n",

      "Ross Why not?\n",
      "Joey Well, it’s complicated. She’s with this other guy. For a long time. Someone from work, too. And I could never do that to the guy, because we’re really good friends.\n",

Anyway, I'm gonna be gone for like, uh... like a week, so, uh, if you wanna reach me, y-you can't. So here's my itinerary (hands a sheet of paper to Monica). Um... here's a picture of me...

      "Chandler Well, sure, but can you play it on a plane? (pats his Travel Scrabble game)\n",

      "Chandler OK, is there a mute button on this woman?\n",
      "Monica I think this is so great! I mean, you and Ross! D-did you have any idea?\n",
      "Rachel No! None! I mean, my first night in the city, he mentioned something about asking me out, but nothing ever happened, so I just... (to Joey): W-well, what else did he say? I mean, does he, like, want to go out with me?\n",
      "Joey Well, given that he's desperately in love with you, he probably wouldn't mind getting a cup of coffee or something.\n",
      "Rachel Ross? All this time? Well, I've got to talk to him. (gets up to leave)\n",
      "Chandler (quickly) H-He's in China!\n",
      "Joey The country.\n",
      "Monica No, no, wait. (checks Ross's itinerary) His flight doesn't leave for another forty-five more minutes.\n",
      "Chandler What about the time difference?\n",
      "Monica From here to the airport?\n",
      "Chandler Yes! (Rachel walks towards door) You're never gonna make it!\n",

      "Rachel I-I-I don't know.\n",
      "Chandler Well then maybe you shouldn't go.\n",
      "Joey He's right, cause if you're just gonna, like, break his heart, that's the kind of thing that can wait.\n",
      "Monica Yeah, but if it's good news, you should tell him now.\n",
      "Rachel I don't know. Maybe I'll know when I see him.\n",
      "Phoebe Here, look, alright, does this help?\n",
      "Rachel Noooo... look, all I know is that I cannot wait a week until I see him. I mean, this is just too big. Y'know, I just, I've just gotta talk to him. I... I gotta... OK, I'll see you later. (opens door)\n",

      "Flight Attendant Sir? Sir? Excuse me, sir? Uh... I have a message for you.\n",
      "Man (confused) What?\n",
      "Flight Attendant It's from Rachel. She said that she loved the present, and she will see you when you get back.\n",
      "Man (to wife): Toby... Oh, for God's sake, I don't know what she's talking about! There's no Rachel! Don't give me that deep freeze.\n",
      "Melanie Mmmmmm... Oh, Joey, Joey, Joey... I think I blacked out there for a minute!\n",

      "Melanie Well, now we've gotta find something fun for you! (she starts kissing his chest)\n",

      "Joey How do you mean?\n",
      "Melanie I don't know, I-I guess I just had you pegged as one of those guys who're always 'me, me, me.' But you... you're a giver. You're like the most generous man I ever met. I mean... you're practically a woman.\n",
      "Monica Uh, so, uh, Rach, uh... do you wanna save this wrapping paper, I mean, it's only a little bit torn... so are you gonna go for it with Ross or should I just throw it out?\n",
      "Rachel I don't know. I don't know... I thought about it all the way there, and I thought about it all the way back... and, uh, oh, you guys, y'know, it's Ross. Y'know what I mean? I mean, it's Ross.\n",
      "Monica and Phoebe Sure.\n",
      "Rachel I don't know, I mean, this is just my initial gut feeling... but I'm thinking... oh, I'm thinking it'd be really great.\n",
      "Monica Oh my God, me too! Oh! Oh, we'd be like friends-in-law! Y'know what the best part is? The best part is that you already know everything about him! I mean, it's like starting on the fifteenth date!\n",
      "Phoebe Yeah, but, y'know, it's... it would be like starting on the fifteenth date.\n",
      "Monica Another good point.\n",
      "Phoebe No, I mean, I mean, when you're at the fifteenth date, y'know, you're already in a very relationshippy place. Y'know, it's... you're committed.\n",
      "Rachel (confused) Huh?\n",
      "Phoebe Well, I mean, then what happens if it doesn't work out?\n",
      "Monica Why isn't it working out?\n",
      "Rachel I don't know... sometimes it doesn't.\n",
      "Monica Is he not cute enough for you?\n",
      "Rachel No!\n",
      "Monica Does he not make enough money?\n",
      "Rachel No, I'm just....\n",
      "Phoebe Maybe there's someone else.\n",

      "Joey Oh, it was amazing. You know how you always think you're great in bed?\n",
      "Chandler The fact that you'd even ask that question shows how little you know me.\n",
      "Joey Well, it's like, last night, I couldn't do the thing that usually makes me great. So I had to do all this other stuff. And the response I got... man, oh man, it was like a ticker tape parade!\n",
      "Chandler Yes, I know, as it happens my room is very very close to the parade route.\n",
      "Joey It was amazing! And not just for her... uh-uh. For me, too. It's like, all of a sudden, I'm blind. But all my other senses are heightened, y'know? It's like... I was able to appreciate it on another level.\n",
      "Chandler I didn't know you had another level.\n",
      "Joey I know! Neither did I!\n",
      "Monica Hey, great skirt! Birthday present?\n",
      "Rachel Yeah.\n",
      "Monica Oh, from who?\n",
      "Rachel From you. I exchanged the blouse you got me.\n",
      "Monica Well, it's the thought. Hey, doesn't Ross's flight get in in a couple hours? At gate 27-B?\n",
      "Rachel Uh, yeah. Uh, Monica, y'know, honey, I've been thinking about it and I've decided this—this whole Ross thing, it's just not a good idea.\n",
      "Monica Oh, why?\n",
      "Rachel Because, I feel like I wouldn't just be going out with him. I would be going out with all of you. Oh, and there would just be all this pressure, and I don't wanna...\n",
      "Monica (gets up) No, no, no, no, no, no pressure, no pressure!\n",
      "Rachel Monica, nothing has even happened yet, and you're already so...\n",
      "Monica I am not 'so'! OK, I was a teensy bit weird at first, but... I'll be good. I promise.\n",
      "Rachel Who is it?\n",
      "Intercom It's me, Carl.\n",
      "Rachel C'mon up.\n",
      "Monica Behind my brother's back? (Rachel glares at her) ... is exactly the kind of crazy thing you won't be hearing from me.\n",
      "Joey Seven hundred bucks!\n",
      "Chandler Alright, you did it! Do we have any fruit?\n",
      "Joey Man, hell of a two weeks, huh? Y'know what, though? I really feel like I learned something.\n",
      "Chandler Really? So, you're gonna stick with this 'it's all for her' thing?\n",
      "Joey What, are you crazy? When a blind man gets his sight back, does he walk around like this? (Joey closes his eyes and walks around with arms spread.)\n",
      "Carl I'm just sayin', if I see one more picture of Ed Begley, Jr. in that stupid electric car, I'm gonna shoot myself! I mean, don't get me wrong... I'm not against environmental issues per se.... it's just that guy!\n",
      "Ross I can't believe you'd rather go out with him than me.\n",
      "Rachel Would you excuse me, please? I'm trying to have a date here.\n",
      "Ross Fine, just stop thinking about me.\n",
      "Ross Can't do it, can you?\n",
      "Rachel So I'm thinking about you. So what?\n",
      "Ross I don't get it. What do you see in this guy, anyway?\n",
      "Rachel Well... he happens to be a very nice... guy....\n",
      "Carl I mean, come on, buddy, get a real car!\n",
      "Ross Rachel, come on. Give us a chance.\n",
      "Rachel Ross, it's too hard.\n",
      "Ross No, no, no... why, because it might get weird for everyone else? Who cares about them. This is about us. Look, I-I've been in love with you since, like, the ninth grade.\n",
      "Rachel Ross, you're like my best friend.\n",
      "Ross I know.\n",
      "Rachel If we broke up, and I lost you...\n",
      "Ross Whoa, whoa, whoa. What makes you think we're gonna break up?\n",
      "Rachel Well, have you been involved with someone where you haven't broken up?\n",
      "Ross (pause) No. But... it only has to happen once. Look, you and I both know we are perfect for each other, right? I mean... so, the only question is... are you attracted to me?\n",
      "Rachel I don't know... I mean, I've never looked at you that way before.\n",
      "Ross Well, start looking.\n",
      "Rachel Wow.\n",
      "Carl Exactly! And you just know I'm gonna be the guy caught behind this hammerhead in traffic!\n",
      "Rachel Right! You're right!\n",
      "Carl Heh... y'know?\n",
      "Rachel You know what?\n",
      "Carl What?\n",
      "Rachel I forgot... I am supposed to pick up a friend at the airport. I am so sorry! I'm so... if you want to stay, and finish your drinks, please do.... (gives him her drink) I mean—I'm sorry. I-I-I gotta go. I'm sorry.\n",
      "Carl But...\n",
      "Rachel (sifting through crowd) Excuse me, pardon me, excuse me, excuse me, sorry. Hi.\n",
      "Man For God's sake, will you let it go? There's no Rachel!\n",
      "Ross Oh, hey, hey, I got that.\n",
      "Julie Oh, thanks, sweetie.\n",
      "Ross No problem. I cannot wait for you to meet my friends.\n",
      "Julie Really?\n",
      "Ross Yeah.\n",
      "Julie You don't think they'll judge and ridicule me?\n",
      "Ross No, no, they will. I just... uh...\n",
      "Ross and Julie Can't wait.\n",
      "Ross Come on, they're gonna love you.\n",

      "Chandler Thanks for trying. (grabs the ticket and starts to leave) Oh, and by the way there is no Count Rushmore!\n",
      "Joey Yeah, then-then who's the guy that painted the faces on the mountain? (Chandler gives him a look like 'You stupid idiot!')\n",

      "Ross Look, that was supposed to be like a private, personal thing between us.\n",
      "Rachel Okay, Ross, Phoebe is my girlfriend, okay, we tell each other everything. You know, I mean, come on, guys do the same thing, I mean, what about all that locker room stuff.\n",
      "Ross That's different, okay. That's like, uh 'Who dated a stripper?' or 'Who did it on the back of the Staton Island Ferry?'.\n",
      "Rachel Were both of those Joey?\n",
      "Ross Yeah. Look, you don't, you don't talk about like, you know, your girlfriend and the intimate stuff you, you do with her.\n",
      "Rachel Not even with your best friend.\n",
      "Ross Noo!\n",
      "Rachel That is so sad. Your missing out on so much, Ross. I mean, the bonding and the sharing, you know. And-and knowing that someone else is going through the same thing you are.\n",
      "Ross Hmph. So what you, you tell each other everything?\n",
      "Rachel Pretty much.\n",
      "Ross Did you talk about the night of five times? Do you tell people about the night of five times?\n",

      "Monica Do you think breaking up with him was a huge mistake?\n",
      "Phoebe All right, there are no questions in the happy place. Okay, just, the warm breeze, and the moonlight flowing through the trees....\n",
      "Monica I'll bet he's totally over me, I'll bet he's fine.\n",
      "Phoebe All right, betting and wagering of any kind, are, I'm sure, not permitted in the happy place. Okay. Just-just, you know, the-the lovely waterfalls, and the, the trickling fountains. And the-the calming sounds of the babbling brook....\n",
      "Monica Okay, this isn't working. I'm still awake and now I have to pee.\n",

      "Joey And you got a 'hate' from that?! Your taking a big leap there...\n",
      "Janice All right, fine, fine, fine, fine, fine, we've got to do something about our little situation here Joey. So, this is my idea: you and me spending some quality time together.\n",
      "Joey But what does that gonna do...\n",
      "Janice For Chandler!\n",
      "Joey Okay. I'm in.\n",
      "Janice Okay. All right. This is what we're gonna call it: 'Joey and Janice's DAY OF FUN!'\n",

      "Joey Yeah, I know, I sleep in the next room.\n",
      "Monica (crying) So, I went down to the post office, and it turns out it was those videos that I ordered for Richard about the Civil War. He loved the Civil War.\n",
      "Phoebe Monica, do you want us to take you home?\n",
      "Monica Uh, huh. (to Ross) Or maybe to a galaxy far, far away. (Rachel, Monica, and Phoebe leave)\n",

      "Chandler I know, And then all of the sudden your Mom pops into your head. And your like 'Mom, get outta here!' You know, but of course, like, after that you can't possibly think of anything else, and you can't, you know, stop what your doing. So it's kinda like, you're, you know. You know...(Ross just stares at him). You don't know!\n",

      "Joey But, hey, look, you know the good thing is, is that we spent the whole day together and I survived, and what's even more amazing, so did she. It was bat day at Shea Stadium.\n",
      "Chandler Well, I guess that's something.\n",
      "Joey No man, that's huge! Now, I know I can stand to be around her, which means I get to hang out with you, which is kinda the whole point, anyway.\n",

      "Mr. Geller Honey, relationships are hard. Like with your Mom and me. You know after we graduated college we broke up for a while. It seems her Father, your Grandfather, wanted her to travel around Europe, like he did. Of course, he got to do it on Uncle Sam's nickel, because he was also strafing German troop trains at the time. However, (turns around and sees that Monica is sleeping and puts a blanket around her, kisses her, picks up the cigar, and starts watching the video)\n",
      "Rachel Okay, here we go. I'm Jabba's prisoner, and you have a really weird look on your face. What? Honey, what is it? Did I get it wrong? Did I get the hair wrong? What? Did you just picture it differently? What? What?\n",
      "Ross No, no it's, um, it's not you, um, it's um, it's (turns and sees his Mom standing where Rachel is)\n",
      "Mrs. Geller Well what is it? Come on sweetie, your like, freaking me out here.\n",

      "Monica Um-mm.\n",
      "Joey All right, give it back to me. (takes the card back, but he looks at the card before he puts it back in the deck, he holds the deck to his forehead, and thinks a little while) 5 of hearts.\n",
      "Ross Real magic does exist.\n",
      "Rachel Wow.\n",
      "Monica Wow. Joey, (sarcastically) how do you do it?\n",
      "Joey I can’t tell you that, no.\n",

      "Rachel Noo, that’s our unbelievably loud upstairs neighbor.\n",
      "Monica He took up the carpet, and now you can hear everything.\n",
      "Phoebe Why don’t you go up there and ask him to ‘step lightly, please?’\n",
      "Monica I have like five times, but the guy is so charming, that I go up there to yell and then I end up apologizing to him.\n",
      "Phoebe Ooh, that is silly. (gets up) I’ll go up there, I’ll tell him to keep it down.\n",

      "Rachel Good luck.\n",
      "Joey All right, all right, all right, all right, all right, you really wanna know how I did it, I’ll show ya. When you handed me back the card, what you didn’t see was, I looked at it so fast that it was invisible to the naked eye. (picks up a card and quickly looks at it) I just did it. (does it again) I just did it, again. Here, I’ll slow it down so that you guys can see it. (looks and the card in slow motion)\n",
      "All Oh, I got it.\n",

      "Joey Sorry, I just, any excuse to tell that story y'know....\n",
      "Ross Hey Chandler, there’s a party tomorrow, you’ll feel better then.\n",

      "Rachel Op.\n",
      "Mr. Kaplan Eh.\n",
      "Rachel Oh, you got me.\n",
      "Mr. Kaplan Well, don’t think I haven’t noticed your potential. Well, I’ve got a project for you that’s a lot more related to fashion. How does that sound?\n",
      "Rachel Oh, that sounds great.\n",
      "Mr. Kaplan Come on over here, sweetheart. (they walk over to a storage closet)\n",
      "Rachel Oh thank you so much Mr. Kaplan, thank you so much.\n",

      "Monica I know honey, I’m sorry.\n",
      "Rachel Oh, I wanna quit, but then I think I should stick it out, then I think why would such a person stay in such a demeaning job, just because it’s remotely related to the field they’re interested in.\n",
      "Monica (gives her a look) Gee, I don’t know Rach. Order up!! I got a Yentel soup, a James Beans, and a Howdy hold the Dowdy!\n",

      "Guy Oh believe me, I-I-I’ve been there. I had to sort mannequin heads at that Mannequins Plus.\n",
      "Rachel Oh well then, so I’m just going to go back to talking to my friend here. And you can go back to enjoying your little hamburger.\n",
      "Guy Ah, just one other thing.\n",
      "Rachel Yes?!\n",

      "Monica Hey Gunther. Hi. (to Phoebe) I mean you’re going out on a date with the noisy guy upstairs?\n",
      "Phoebe Well, he’s very charming.\n",
      "Monica I know, he’s too charming, but if you two start going out, then it’s just gonna make it so much harder for me to hate him.\n",
      "Phoebe Well, you’re just gonna have to try.\n",
      "Monica Joey, where are the Jell-o shots?\n",

      "Rachel Hi! So I’m out having lunch at Monica’s and this guy starts talking to me, and it turns out he works for a buyer at Bloomingdale’s and there happens to be an opening in his department. So I gave him my phone number and he’s gonna call me this weekend to see if he can get me an interview!\n",
      "Ross Wow!\n",
      "Rachel I know!\n",
      "Ross What, so this guy is helping you for no apparent reason?\n",
      "Rachel Uh-huh!\n",
      "Ross And he’s, he’s a total stranger?\n",
      "Rachel Yeah! His name is um, Mark something.\n",
      "Ross Huh. Sounds like Mark Something wants to have some sex.\n",
      "Rachel What!?\n",
      "Ross Well, I’m just saying, I mean why else would he just, y'know, swoop in out of nowhere for no reason.\n",
      "Rachel To be nice.\n",
      "Ross Hey, Joey. Are men ever nice to strange women for no reason?\n",
      "Joey No, only for sex.\n",
      "Ross Thank you. (to Rachel) So did you ah, did you tell Mark Something about me?\n",
      "Rachel I didn’t have to, because I was wearing my ‘I heart Ross’ sandwich board and ringing my bell.\n",
      "Ross Uh-huh.\n",
      "Joey’s Sisters (entering) Joey!!! Happy Birthday!! (all 7 of them look almost identical)\n",

      "Phoebe (to one of his sisters, Cookie) Hey!\n",
      "Cookie Hey. What are we drinkin’ over here.\n",
      "Phoebe Well, I have ah, vodka and cranberry juice.\n",
      "Cookie No kiddin,’ that’s the exact same drink I made myself right after I shot my husband.\n",
      "Phoebe Wow. Okay, I don’t know how to talk to you.\n",
      "Sister 1 (to Chandler) What ‘cha doing?\n",
      "Chandler Oh, I’m taking my ex-girlfriend of my speed dialer.\n",
      "Joey’s Sisters Oh!!\n",
      "Chandler No-no-no-no, no, it’s a good thing. Why must we dial so speedily anyway? Why must we rush through life? Why can’t we savor the precious moments? (to one of Joey’s sisters) Those are some huge breasts you have.\n",
      "Ross Hi.\n",
      "Monica Hi.\n",
      "Ross Yeah. So um, I-I heard about this ah, Mark guy that ah, Rachel met today.\n",
      "Monica Isn’t that great?\n",
      "Ross Oh yeah! So ah, kinda pretty, pretty good. He sounds like a nice, good guy.\n",
      "Monica Oh, he is. And he is so dreamy. I mean, y'know what, when he left I actually used the phrase, ‘Hummina-hummina-hummina.’ (walks away)\n",
      "Ross That’s excellent.\n",
      "Ross (to Rachel) So, he’s just a nice guy. You really think this Mark doesn’t want anything in exchange for helping him?\n",
      "Rachel Well, I assume I’ll have to take showers with him, but y'know, that’s true of any job.\n",
      "Monica How ya feelin’?\n",
      "Chandler Well, my apartment isn’t there anymore, because I drank it.\n",
      "Phoebe Where’d you get too? We lost you after you opened up all the presents.\n",
      "Ross Yeah.\n",
      "Chandler Yeah, I ended up in the storage room, and not alone.\n",
      "All Woooo hoooo!!!\n",
      "Chandler Ow, no ‘woo-hooing,’ no ‘woo-hooing.’\n",
      "Phoebe Why, what happened?\n",
      "Chandler Ah, I fooled around with Joey’s sister. (Phoebe gasps) Well, that’s not the worst part.\n",
      "Monica What is the worse part?\n",
      "Chandler I can’t remember which sister.\n",
      "Ross (to Rachel) You see what men do! Don’t tell me men are not nice! (points to Chandler) This is men!!\n",
      "Monica Are you insane? I mean Joey, is going to kill you, he’s actually going to kill you dead.\n",
      "Chandler Okay! You don’t think I thought of that?\n",
      "Phoebe How can you not know which one?\n",
      "Rachel I mean that’s unbelievable.\n",
      "Monica I mean, was it Gina?\n",
      "Ross Which one is Gina?\n",
      "Rachel Dark, big hair, with the airplane earrings.\n",
      "Monica No, no, no, that’s Dina.\n",
      "Chandler (to Monica) You see you can’t tell which one is which either, dwha!!\n",
      "Phoebe We didn’t fool around with any of them. Dwha! Dwha!\n",
      "Chandler Veronica. Look, it’s got to be Veronica, the girl in the red skirt. I definitely stuck my tongue down her throat.\n",
      "Monica That was me.\n",
      "Chandler Look, when I’ve been drinking, sometimes I tend to get overly friendly, and I’m sorry.\n",
      "Monica That’s okay.\n",
      "Rachel That’s all right.\n",
      "Ross That’s okay.\n",
      "Joey (angrily entering, to Chandler) Can I talk to you for a second?!\n",
      "Ross Hey, Joey.\n",
      "Rachel Hey. (they all walk away from Chandler)\n",
      "Joey Come on!! (motions for Chandler to come with him)\n",
      "Chandler Why can’t we talk in here? With, with, witnesses.\n",
      "Joey I just got off the phone with my sister.\n",
      "Ross Ah, which, which one?\n",
      "Joey Mary-Angela.\n",
      "Ross Mary-Angela.\n",
      "Joey Yeah.\n",
      "Monica Y'know which one was she again?\n",
      "Joey Why don’t you ask Chandler, ‘cause he’s the one that fooled around with her. She told me you said you could really fall for her. Now is that true? Or are you just gettin’ over Janice by groping my sister.\n",
      "Chandler It’s gotta be the first one.\n",
      "Joey Really? That’s great! You and my sister, sittin’ in a tree.\n",
      "Chandler Yep, I’m in a tree.\n",
      "Rachel Did he call? Did Mark call?\n",
      "Monica No honey, I’m sorry, but the weekend’s not over yet.\n",
      "Rachel Oh. (we hear laughing from the upstairs apartment) Oh my God, is that Phoebe?\n",
      "Monica I guess they’re back from their date.\n",
      "Rachel Music. Very nice.\n",
      "Monica Oh my God!\n",
      "Rachel So, how are you?\n",
      "Monica I am good. I finished my book.\n",
      "Rachel Oh yeah, what’s it about?\n",
      "Monica I don’t remember. Do you wanna take a walk?\n",
      "Rachel Yeah, I do. (they both run out)\n",
      "Ross Dear Mary-Angela. Hi. How’s it going. This is the hardest letter I’ve ever had to write. (to Chandler) What the hell’s a matter with you? How do you think Joey’s going to react when he finds out that you blew off his sister with a letter?\n",
      "Chandler Well, that’s the part where you tell him that I moved to France. When actually I’ll be in Cuba.\n",
      "Ross All right, look, look, you’ve got to do this yourself, okay in person. At least you know her name. You just go to the house and you ask for Mary-Angela, okay, when which ever one she is comes to the door, you take her for a walk, you let her down easy.\n",
      "Chandler What if Mary-Angela comes to the door and I ask for Mary-Angela?\n",
      "Ross Where in Cuba?\n",
      "Chandler (shocked) Joey, what-wh-wh-wha-wh-wha-wh-wha-wh-wha-what are you doing here?\n",
      "Joey Waiting for my Grandma to finish my laundry. What about you?\n",
      "Chandler I’m here to see Mary-Angela.\n",
      "Joey You are so the man! (motions him to come in, and he does) Now look, listen, listen, you got to be cool, ‘cause my Grandma doesn’t know about you two yet, and you do not want to tick her off. She was like the sixth person to spit on Mussolini's hanging body. Yeah.\n",
      "Chandler Where’s Mary-Angela?\n",
      "Joey She’s right in there. (motions to the living room)\n",
      "Joey’s Sisters Hey, Chandler!\n",
      "Rachel I can’t believe Mark didn’t call. It’s Sunday night, and he didn’t call.\n",
      "Ross Bummer.\n",
      "Rachel (to Ross) Yeah, right. Look at you, you’re practically giddy.\n",
      "Ross No, I’m genuinely sorry the Mark thing didn’t work out. Look, Rach, I want only good things for you.\n",
      "Monica Wait a minute, why don’t you just call Mark. (they both look up in shock) I mean, who says you have to sit here and wait for him, you’ve got to make stuff happen.\n",
      "Ross But, you, you don’t want to seem too pushy.\n",
      "Monica (to Ross) Honey, it’s not pushy, he gave her his home number.\n",
      "Ross (to Rachel, as she gets his number) What, he gave you his home number? As in like, to, to his home?\n",
      "Rachel Yeah, and you don’t mind if I call, because you only want good things for me.\n",
      "Ross That’s right good things, that-that is what I said. (glances at Monica)\n",
      "Rachel (on phone) Hello, Mark? Hi, it’s Rachel Green. (listens) Oh no, don’t you apologize. (listens) Yeah, I’ll hold. (to Monica and Ross) He left my number at work, but he was helping his niece with her report on the pioneers.\n",
      "Ross That is so made up!\n",
      "Rachel (on phone) Yeah, oh my God, tomorrow! That, no, it’s perfect. Oh God, thank you soo much. Great! Bye! (hangs up phone) I got the interview!\n",
      "Monica Yay!\n",
      "Ross There you go.\n",
      "Rachel He even offered to meet me for lunch tomorrow to prep me for it.\n",
      "Monica Oh, that is amazing!\n",
      "Ross Yeah well, if I know Mark, and I think I do, I’d expect nothing less.\n",
      "Rachel I got to figure out what I’m going to wear.\n",
      "Ross High collar and baggy pants say I’m a pro.\n",
      "Rachel Yeah! Right! Okay, I’ll see you guys later. (starts to leave) Woo hoo!\n",
      "Ross You go get ‘em. (to Monica) What did I do to you? Did I hurt you in some way?\n",
      "Monica What?\n",
      "Ross ‘Why don’t you call him?!’ Well, thank you very much! Y'know now he is going to prep her, y'know prep her, as in what you do when you surgically remove the boyfriend!\n",
      "Monica Are you crazy?!\n",
      "Ross Am I! Am I! Am I out of my mind! Am I losing my senses!! This dreamy guy is taking my girlfriend out for a meal.\n",
      "Monica What?! Ross y'know this isn’t even about you! I mean this is about Rachel and something wonderful happening for her. I mean you know even if you’re right, what if he wants to sleep with her, does it mean he gets too?\n",
      "Ross No.\n",
      "Monica I mean don’t you trust her?\n",
      "Ross Well, yeah!\n",
      "Monica Then get over yourself! Grow up!\n",
      "Ross (shyly) You grow up.\n",
      "Chandler This teramisu is, is excellent. Did you make it Mary-Angela?\n",
      "Joey’s Grandmother No! I did!\n",
      "Chandler Well, it’s, it’s yummy. So Mary-Angela do you like it?\n",
      "Joey’s Grandmother Of course! It’s her favorite.\n",
      "Chandler So um, Mary-Angela, what’s your second favorite?\n",
      "Joey’s Grandmother More of Grandma’s teramisu.\n",
      "Chandler Would you just please....give me the receipt ‘cause this is great. It’s top notch.\n",
      "Joey’s Grandmother That dies with me.\n",
      "Chandler So will I.\n",
      "Joey’s Sister Excuse yourself, and go to the bathroom.\n",
      "Chandler Oh no-no-no I was just squinting. That doesn’t mean anything.\n",
      "Joey’s Sister (whispering in his ear) Just do it.\n",
      "Chandler Will you excuse me I have to um..... (walks to the hall)\n",
      "Chandler (startled) Hey!\n",
      "Joey’s Sister Finally, I thought we’d never be alone. Can I just tell you something, I have not stopped thinking about you since the party. (kisses him)\n",
      "Chandler Look, I may have jumped the gun here. (she tries to kiss him, but he ducks it and moves away) Um, I just got out of a relationship and I’m not really in a, in a commitment kind of place.\n",
      "Joey’s Sister So! Me neither! God, Mary-Angela was right you do have the softest lips.\n",
      "Chandler Ahhhh, you’re not Mary-Angela.\n",
      "Joey’s Sister No, I’m Mary-Theresa.\n",
      "Chandler This is so bad. If-if you’re not Mary-Angela, then-then who is?\n",
      "Mary-Angela (standing behind Chandler) I am!\n",
      "Chandler Oh, this is soo bad. (doesn’t see Mary-Angela)\n",
      "Mary-Angela Joey!!!\n",
      "Chandler No Joey! No Joey! Don’t Joey! Joey!\n",
      "Joey What’s goin’ on?\n",
      "Chandler (pats him on the shoulder) You’re it! Now run and hide!\n",
      "Mary-Theresa It’s no big deal. Chandler was just kissin’ me because he thought I was Mary-Angela.\n",
      "Joey What?! How could you do that, how could you think she was Mary-Angela?\n",
      "Chandler I wasn’t sure which one Mary-Angela was. (all of Joey’s sisters gasp) Look, I’m sorry okay, I was really drunk, and you all look really similar.\n",
      "Joey’s Sister I say, punch him Joey.\n",
      "All Yeah! Punch him!!\n",
      "Chandler Y'know what, we should all calm down because your brother’s not going to punch me. (to Joey) Are ya?\n",
      "Joey Well, that is usually what I would do. But I just never thought you’d be on the receiving end of it. How could you do this?!\n",
      "Chandler Joey if you wanna punch me, go ahead, I deserve it. But I just want you to know that I would never soberly hurt you or your family, you’re my best friend. I would never do anything like this ever again.\n",
      "Cookie So what. I say, punch him.\n",
      "All Yeah! Punch him! Punch him!\n",
      "Joey No! No! No! No, I’m not going to punch Chandler.\n",
      "Cookie I’ll do it.\n",
      "Joey No you won’t. Look he knows he did a terrible thing and I believe him, he’s sorry. But, (to Chandler) you’ve got one more apology to make, all right, you’ve got to apologize to Mary-Angela.\n",
      "Chandler Okay, absolutely!\n",
      "Joey All right.\n",
      "Chandler You’ve got it. (he starts to look at his sister’s, but he still doesn’t know which one is Mary-Angela.)\n",
      "Joey Cookie, now you can punch him!\n",
      "Chandler What?! (Cookie punches him)\n",
      "Rachel (getting of the elevator and noticing Ross) Hey!\n",
      "Ross Hi!\n",
      "Rachel What are you doing here?\n",
      "Ross Ah y'know, this building is on my paper route so I... (gives her a flower)\n",

      "Ross Hi. (kisses her)\n",
      "Rachel Hi.\n",
      "Ross How’d did it go?\n",
      "Rachel Oh well, the woman I interviewed with was pretty tough, but y'know thank God Mark coached me, because once I started talking about the fall line, she got all happy and wouldn’t shut up.\n",
      "Ross I’m so proud of you.\n",

      "Rachel Ross said he died.\n",
      "Monica He didn't die. I saw his daughter last week. Said he was fine. Her on the other hand, botched Botox.\n",
      "Rachel Oh, great! Well, then I'm gonna take Emma to see him. I wonder why Ross said that he died.\n",
      "Monica Oh, maybe he was getting him confused with his childhood therapist.\n",

      "Joey (Checks him out) Okay! (Walks over to his table and sits down with him)\n",
      "Mike I gotta tell you, I can't believe I'm doing this with you. Although I did just get out of a nine-year relationship, so I guess I should be open and taking some risks.\n",
      "Joey Everything is gonna be fine. Just follow my lead, okay? All you have to do is pretend to be Mike.\n",
      "Mike I am Mike.\n",
      "Joey Atta boy!\n",

      "Joey (Laughs) From school.\n",
      "Mike Yeah, we met in college. (Off Joey's look) I mean, high school.\n",
      "Phoebe Wow, you guys go way back then. So what are you up to these days?\n",
      "Mike Well, I'm a lawyer.\n",
      "Joey Mike, 'attorney at law'!\n",
      "Mike Actually, I just gave up my practice.\n",
      "Joey What? That's the kinda thing you usually run by me.\n",
      "Mike I always wanted to play piano professionally, and I figured if I don't do this now, I never will.\n",
      "Phoebe Wow, that's great! I liked that better than the law thing, so...\n",
      "Joey Which is why I waited until now to introduce you to Mike.\n",
      "Mary Ellen I thought you thought he was still a lawyer.\n",
      "Joey No, no, that's not what I meant. Let's get you a cocktail.\n",
      "Monica Hey!\n",
      "Chandler Hey!\n",
      "Monica What are you doing?\n",
      "Chandler Looking for restaurant jobs for you in Tulsa.\n",
      "Monica That's so sweet. Find anything?\n",
      "Chandler Slim Pickings.\n",
      "Monica Nothing, huh?\n",
      "Chandler No, 'Slim Pickings', it's a barbecue restaurant. They're looking for a cook. Actually 'cook' may be a bit of a stretch. They're looking for someone to shovel mesquite.\n",
      "Monica 'Slim Pickings'...That is so cheesy.\n",
      "Chandler 'So Cheesy' also has an opening.\n",
      "Monica Honey, that's okay. I actually know this woman, Nancy, who's a restaurant biz head-hunter. Maybe she'll know of something.\n",
      "Chandler Can I just say how much I appreciate you coming with me. When we get to Tulsa I'm taking you for a great dinner at 'Slim Pickings'. 'So Cheesy'? 'Whole Hog'? It's going to be tough to keep Kosher in Tulsa.\n",
      "Monica (On phone) Hi, Nancy. Hi, it's Monica Geller. I'm good. Listen, I'm looking for a job in Tulsa. Well yeah, my husband has been relocated...Because I love him! No, I don't want a job in New York. Javo (sp?) is looking? Oh my God! He asked for me personally? Oh my God! Oh, wow, this is really flattering, but I'm moving to Tulsa. Yeah, so if you would tell Javo (sp?) 'I'll take it!'\n",
      "Rachel Hi, my name is Rachel Green, I have an appointment for Emma.\n",
      "Receptionist Dr. Gettleman is finishing up with a patient, he should be out shortly.\n",
      "Dr. Gettleman (To a patient) I think you just have a cold, it's definitely not Strep.\n",
      "Ross Thanks doctor.\n",
      "Dr. Gettleman Would you like a lollypop?\n",
      "Ross You even have to ask?! (He grabs a lollypop out of a jar) (Sees Rachel) (To Rachel) He is alive!\n",
      "Phoebe You know, it's so surprising that you and Joey have known each other for so long and I've never heard about you.\n",
      "Joey Yeah, that's because we had a bit of a falling out. Mike hit my mom with a car.\n",
      "Mike No, I didn't.\n",
      "Joey That's okay Mike, I have forgiven you. And now we're friends again everything's great!\n",
      "Joey Please, we're trying to have a conversation. (Pushes the wine glass closer to Mary Ellen.)\n",
      "Mary Ellen Wow, you're a lot nicer on 'Days of Our Lives'.\n",
      "Mike 'Days of Our Lives'! That's why you look so familiar!\n",
      "Phoebe What?!\n",
      "Mike What?!\n",
      "Joey What?!\n",
      "Phoebe Do you not know each other?\n",
      "Joey (Laughs) Of course we do! Mike is playing a game that we used to play in high school. Yeah, where we pretend we don't know each other. We played all kinds of games. (To Mike) Hey, remember the one where I punch you in the face for not being cool?!\n",
      "Phoebe Mike, let me ask you something. How many sisters does Joey have?\n",
      "Mike (Joey holds up six fingers) Six!\n",
      "Joey What are you doing? I said seven! (Holds up six fingers.) (Realizes his mistake) Argh!!!\n",
      "Phoebe Joey, why did you set me up with a stranger?\n",
      "Joey Because I forgot about our date, I'm so sorry.\n",
      "Mike I'm sorry too. And just to be clear, I didn't hit his mother with a car.\n",
      "Phoebe (To Joey) You are unbelievable! I spent so much time finding the perfect girl for you, you know. Mary Ellen is really smart and cute and loose.\n",
      "Mary Ellen Hey!\n",
      "Phoebe Who are you kidding? (To Joey) You just find some guy off the street for me? Oh God! This is humiliating!\n",
      "Joey Look Phoebe I'm so sorry! Hey, look, if you don't like this guy I can find you a better one. (Looks around) Mike!! Mike!!\n",
      "Phoebe I'm out of here (She leaves)\n",
      "Mike It was nice meeting you!\n",
      "Joey (To Mary Ellen) You're leaving too?\n",
      "Mary Ellen I'll stay if you can tell me my name.\n",
      "Joey Good night!\n",
      "Chandler Honey, we're leaving tomorrow you've still got a lot of packing to do.\n",
      "Monica You're right. (Pause) Maybe I shouldn't go.\n",
      "Chandler What?\n",
      "Monica So Nancy told me about this job at this great restaurant, Javo (sp?). It's just a little outside of Tulsa.\n",
      "Chandler How far outside?\n",
      "Monica Manhattan.\n",
      "Chandler And you're thinking of taking it? (Pause) So before you said being me with me was more important than any job, but I guess now it's old job, (Raises his hand) me, (Raises his hand) new job.\n",
      "Monica I'm gonna miss this hand! Okay I know it's a lot to ask, but oh my God Chandler, this is a once in a lifetime opportunity.\n",
      "Chandler What happened to 'you can't live without me four days a week'?\n",
      "Monica Well, if you really think about it, I mean four days is not that long. I mean, I see you Monday before you go to work, and I see you Thursday when you get back, and I always work late on Tuesdays, so really if you think about it, it's really just one day. And well, if we can't make it one day, we've got real problems my friend.\n",
      "Chandler I think you should take the job.\n",
      "Monica Really?\n",
      "Chandler Yeah. I know it must be important to you when you start chattering like a monkey.\n",
      "Monica That's the nicest anyone has ever said to me!\n",
      "Ross Hey!\n",
      "Monica How was the pediatrician?\n",
      "Rachel Oh, I really liked him. (Looks at Ross) Yeah, it was really, really, really good.\n",
      "Ross You promised you wouldn't say anything.\n",
      "Rachel I know. (Pause) Ross still sees his pediatrician!!! (To Ross) I don't care!\n",
      "Monica Are you serious? You still see Dr. Gettleman?\n",
      "Ross He's a brilliant diagnostician!\n",
      "Chandler Diagnostician or boo-boo fixer?\n",
      "Rachel Ross, seriously! You've gotta go to an appropriate doctor.\n",
      "Ross Why? Why? I know it's a little weird, but hey, he's a great doctor, okay? He knows my medical history, and every time I go in there, he makes a big deal. 'Ah look, it's my favorite patient!'\n",
      "Chandler Does he say that before he sticks his thermometer in your touchy?\n",
      "Ross Hey, I seem to remember someone bringing his security blanket to college!\n",
      "Chandler That was not a security blanket! That was a wall-hanging!\n",
      "Ross It didn't spend much time on the wall!!!\n",
      "Mike Excuse me, hi. I was hoping I would run into you. Can we talk?\n",
      "Phoebe Sure.\n",
      "Mike I'm sorry, really, I'm so embarrassed. Really, I'm a pretty nice guy. Just ask my parole officer...Apparently I'm not a funny guy.\n",
      "Phoebe Why did you go along with that?\n",
      "Mike Because I was told I'd get a free dinner, which I didn't. And that I'd meet a pretty girl. Which I did.\n",
      "Phoebe That's true. (Pause) Well, is anything you told me about yourself true?\n",
      "Mike My name in Mike, and I do play piano.\n",
      "Phoebe Prove it.\n",
      "Mike There isn't a piano here.\n",
      "Phoebe That wouldn't stand in the way of a true pianist.\n",
      "Mike (Plays 'air piano')\n",
      "Phoebe You are really good! I play a little guitar myself.\n",
      "Mike Really?\n",
      "Phoebe Uhuh.\n",
      "Mike That's great. What kind of music do you play?\n",
      "Phoebe Well, like acoustic folksy stuff. You know? But right now I'm working on a couple 'Iron Maiden' covers.\n",
      "Mike Do you think that maybe, sometime, I could...\n",
      "Phoebe It's okay. Go ahead, ask me out.\n",
      "Mike Okay. Do you think maybe sometime I could take you out?\n",
      "Joey (Walks In)\n",
      "Phoebe (To Mike) Oh, you just caught me off guard! Yeah, that would be nice.\n",
      "Joey Look at this. My two best friends!\n",

      "Sally It's hard isn't it? There's almost no time for a social life. I mean, where are you gonna meet someone?\n",

      "Chandler Our balcony? Seriously? That's so funny because I told Monica we should put lights on our balcony. And she said\n",
      "Ross Right that's why I came over to talk about. Hum...I saw Rachel kissing some guy on your balcony,\n",
      "Chandler So are you gonna...talk to her?\n",
      "Ross Why...Why should I? I mean if she wants to move on, that's fine!\n",
      "Chandler You know when \"That's fine\" sounds true when someone yells it and spits!\n",
      "Ross No I'm serious. I mean she wants to date people? Fine! I don't care but...at least she could have told me. You know\n",
      "Chandler No no no. Good. So you're moving on? Do you have any idea where you're moving?\n",
      "Ross I don't know. I mean I have plenty of opportunity. Just just now there were some women at the coffee house smiled at me.\n",
      "Chandler Dude, don't rub my face in your crazy single life!\n",
      "Ross Well, and how about this? There is an anthropologist at school who totally came on to me during the inter-departmental\n",
      "Chandler Why did I get married?!\n",
      "Joey Hey! Let me ask you guys something. I have a new headshot taken tomorrow right and the photographer said she thinks I\n",
      "Phoebe Well it depends.\n",
      "Joey On...?\n",
      "Phoebe On how far along he's in the sex change process!\n",
      "Monica No I totally disagree. No I think it's fine for a guy to do something like that. Such you an actor. Not that you need to,\n",
      "Joey Ok! Stop it you guys! Stop staring! You're freaking me out!\n",
      "Phoebe Your knuckles are kinda hairy too...\n",
      "Joey Oh man! I have to get those done too?!\n",
      "Phoebe Wow! Talking about high maintenance\n",
      "Joey Hey hey! You dye your hair!\n",
      "Phoebe I'm a woman!\n",
      "Joey Arghhh! Double standards!\n",
      "Phoebe Oh before I forget, are you coming to Mike's piano bar tonight?\n",
      "Monica Only if I don't have to get up and sing.\n",
      "Phoebe But everybody sings. It's so much fun! Last time this adorable old man got out there, forgot all of the words, flipped out\n",
      "Monica It's just, I'm not good at singing.\n",
      "Phoebe Oh! What's the matter? Are you scared? You're afraid I'm a better singer? You're afraid I'm gonna beat you at singing?\n",
      "Monica No no, it's not working on me. Wow! I must be growing up!\n",
      "Phoebe OK fine! Please come and support Mike. You don't have to sing.\n",
      "Monica So I don't have to sing and I can just sit there and pass judgments on others?\n",
      "Phoebe While drinking...\n",
      "Monica I'm there!\n",
      "Rachel Hi guys! Listen I really need your help. I think I did something really stupid.\n",
      "Phoebe Well yes Rachel but you got something so beautiful out there\n",
      "Rachel No not that. I kissed Gavin last night.\n",
      "Phoebe Oh my god.\n",
      "Monica You kissed him?\n",
      "Rachel Yeah. It was after the party, we were on the balcony and...\n",
      "Monica Wait wait wait. I was at home the whole time. How did I missed that?\n",
      "Phoebe It was the end of the party, you were probably ironing wrapping paper.\n",
      "Monica Oh yeah...So how did you end up kissing?\n",
      "Rachel You know we were all alone and he was being really nice to me and, oh and he gave me this scarf...\n",
      "Monica I thought you hated him?\n",
      "Rachel You know honey, there is a thin line between love and hate, and it turns out that line...is a scarf!\n",
      "Monica So are you thinking of starting up something with this guy?\n",
      "Rachel I don't know. It's so complicated. I work with this guy, you know, I have the baby, and I have Ross, and I just...I don't\n",
      "Monica Sounds like you need to think about what you want, talk to Gavin, and you definitely should talk to Ross\n",
      "Rachel Or...I could call in sick and not deal with it at all...\n",
      "Phoebe Wow! Five-month maternity leave, you're back for four days, kiss a co-worker, call in sick, they are lucky to have you!!\n",
      "Salon girl Hi\n",
      "Joey Hey. I'm here for my eyebrow appointment.\n",
      "Salon girl Name?\n",
      "Joey Chandler Bing.\n",
      "Salon girl Ok. Very good. Have a seat right over here Mr. Bing and Sonia will be right with you.\n",
      "Joey OK Thanks.\n",
      "Sonia I'll take care of it\n",
      "Joey Thanks. Do you get a lot of guys in here?\n",
      "Sonia Oh absolutely.\n",
      "Joey Oh good...\n",
      "Sonia Are you looking to meet somebody?\n",
      "Joey All right let's just do this.\n",
      "Sonia We'll get to the wax in a minute. First I want to tweeze some of the strays, ok? This may sting just a little bit...\n",
      "Joey Please I have an extremely high threshold...Holly Mother Of God! My face! My face!! I'm all right! I'm all right!\n",
      "Chandler Hey it's the most eligible man in NY. How's the moving on going?\n",
      "Ross Not well. I went on the subway again and someone did sit on my hand but that person was neither female nor wearing pants.\n",
      "Chandler Well maybe you're going about this the wrong way. You know I mean think about it. Single white male, divorced three times,\n",
      "Ross That's funny...Do you think you'll ever work again?\n",
      "Chandler What are doing? You know I can only dish it out!\n",
      "Ross I can't believe Rachel just moved on and didn't say anything to me\n",
      "Chandler Maybe she didn't move on, you know...maybe that kiss was just an impulsive one-time birthday thing\n",
      "Ross No no, about a month ago she gave her number to some guy in a bar.\n",
      "Chandler Did she go out with him?\n",
      "Ross No. When he called, I...I threw the message away.\n",
      "Chandler Ah! The high road...\n",
      "Ross You know what? Enough! Enough talking! I have to get moving! Hey check out those two blondes over there!\n",
      "Chandler Are you trying to get everybody divorced?\n",
      "Ross You don't have to do anything. It will just be easier if it is the two of us, like college, remember? You...you break the\n",
      "Chandler I thought I had to make the jokes!\n",
      "Ross Don't you have to be at work?\n",
      "Chandler Oh come on! Hello! Hi! My name is Chandler, here's my friend Ross right here, and we were wondering you know if you're up for it.\n",
      "Ross Hum...So...hum...Oh hey I noticed you were reading the paper...another flood in Europe? Here�s a question: \"Would you...\n",
      "Blonde girl Sorry...we were just leaving\n",
      "Chandler We still got it!\n",
      "Rachel Who is it?\n",
      "Gavin Gavin! I brought you some soup.\n",
      "Rachel Why?\n",
      "Gavin I heard you were sick...\n",
      "Rachel Oh! Right! Yeah! Hold on, I'll be just clean up in here a little bit! Hello Gavin\n",
      "Gavin I missed you at work today. How are you feeling?\n",
      "Rachel I a not gonna lie to you, I'm pretty sick\n",
      "Gavin Oh! Good! Because I was having a totally paranoid moment when I thought you called in sick to avoid me.\n",
      "Rachel Oh no no no\n",
      "Gavin So I had fun last night\n",
      "Rachel So did I\n",
      "Gavin Exactly how contagious is this thing you have? I mean is it a cold for standing on the balcony or did a monkey bite you?\n",
      "Rachel It's just a cold\n",
      "Gavin Do you have fever? Let me see. Hum...\n",
      "Rachel What? What's the matter?\n",
      "Gavin What's Ross doing to you on that picture?\n",
      "Rachel Oh he's dusting me with a fossil brush. He thought it would be funny.\n",
      "Gavin Right. Right. Ross. So what's the deal with you guys? I don't want to get in the middle of anything\n",
      "Rachel Oh you're not. You're not gonna get in the middle of anything, don't worry about Ross really, really.\n",
      "Gavin Yeah! But you said not to worry about...\n",
      "Rachel I lied! And I'm not sick! Just stay behind the curtain!\n",
      "Molly Hi!\n",
      "Rachel Oh! Molly! You're not Ross.\n",
      "Molly No I'm here to take Emma to your mother's, remember?\n",
      "Rachel Right, right, yes!\n",
      "Molly Don't panic!\n",
      "Rachel What?\n",
      "Molly There is a man behind your curtain. I have a mace in my purse.\n",
      "Rachel No! That's OK! That's OK! That's OK! No no no no! This is my business associate Gavin. He's just being silly.\n",
      "Gavin Hi! Gavin! Please to meet you. It was my idea to stand there.\n",
      "Molly Hello! I just go and get Emma.\n",
      "Rachel OK.\n",
      "Gavin So hum...Why did I have to hide?\n",
      "Rachel I thought it was Ross.\n",
      "Gavin So what if it was? I thought there was nothing going on between you two...\n",
      "Rachel There isn't. There is totally isn't.\n",
      "Gavin You hear a key in the hole and you jump like a young bronco coming out of a chute for the first time. I used to be a\n",
      "Rachel All right. Look. Gavin...I...I guess I felt guilty that you were here, which I shouldn't. You know Ross and I are not in\n",
      "Gavin It's OK. I know it's probably not my place but can I give you a piece of advice?\n",
      "Rachel Yes\n",
      "Gavin I think you should talk to Ross about all this.\n",
      "Rachel People keep saying that. Oh I'm sorry Gavin\n",
      "Gavin Don't be. It's just bad timing.\n",
      "Rachel So seriously...rodeo clown?\n",
      "Gavin One of the best, ma'am, one of the best...\n",
      "Phoebe \"No time for losers, 'cause we are the champions of the world...!\" Thank you!\n",
      "Mike Oh she's my girlfriend. That's not just how we do it here. I got to get a break and when we come back we've got Kenneth\n",
      "Phoebe Hi hi...Oh you have got to sing.\n",
      "Monica No I told you I can't.\n",
      "Phoebe But you would have so much fun and you have a really nice voice.\n",
      "Monica What have you heard me sing?\n",
      "Phoebe All the time when you're cooking.\n",
      "Monica What?\n",
      "Phoebe Yeah you're always singing \"Yummy yummy yummy, I've got love in my tummy\"\n",
      "Monica Yeah I do rock that one.\n",
      "Phoebe OK so isn't there a little part of you that wants to get up there?\n",
      "Monica Just a little but...it's just so scary! I don't even know what I would sing...\n",
      "Mike Well I've got a book around...\n",
      "Monica \"Delta Dawn\"\n",
      "Ross Hi! I could help not notice, but that's an unusual necklace\n",
      "Woman You already hit on me an hour ago\n",
      "Ross Right, so that's a firm \"no\". I cannot believe this, I just keep striking out.\n",
      "Chandler I don't get it neither, I mean you're obviously desperate, you're asking women how they want to be killed\n",
      "Ross This is great. Rachel's gonna keep kissing guys until she finds the one she wants and I'm gonna die alone.\n",
      "Chandler By drowning or...?!\n",
      "Michelle Why would he break up with me?\n",
      "Her friend I don't know sweetie.\n",
      "Michelle All I ever wanted was just love him and have him love me back. I mean, am I so unlovable?\n",
      "Chandler Well...\n",
      "Ross I know! (he stands)\n",
      "Mike All right, that was Kenneth with his much too literal rendition of \"I touch myself\". Coming up next we've got Monica\n",
      "Monica Wait wait! I can't sing in front of all these people.\n",
      "Phoebe Just pretend they're not even here! It's OK Monica, when that spotlight hits you it so bright you won't see anyone\n",
      "Monica Hi! I'm Monica and I'm gonna be singing \"Delta Dawn\"\n",
      "Phoebe Can you totally see through her shirt ?\n",
      "Mike Like an X-Ray. Bad day not to wear a bra.\n",
      "Monica \"To take you to his mansion in the sky-y?\"\n",
      "Joey Hey, I need your help.\n",
      "Chandler Wow, it seems serious. What seems to be the problem, Ashley Judd?\n",
      "Joey Look, I'll get new headshot taken, all right, so I want to get my eyebrows shaped\n",
      "Chandler I am sorry, moment to make fun of that, please!\n",
      "Joey You may be a sissy but I'll still (pound you out on ground). All right, it hurts so bad, I could only let her do one\n",
      "Chandler It�s like a baby caterpillar chasing its mama!\n",
      "Joey All right, look, you got to help me out, ok? Look, I have the magic marker, I want you to fill in the skinny one so\n",
      "Chandler Ok. First of all, this is green!\n",
      "Joey What the hell am I supposed to do!\n",
      "Chandler All right, I will help you out but you have to promise me you will not tell anyone what I am about to tell you.\n",
      "Joey What, what.\n",
      "Chandler Ok, you know how most kids get their allowance from mowing the lawn or taking out the garbage, well I earned mine\n",
      "Joey Oh my God!\n",
      "Chandler Yeah, well, I guess you don�t need my help Victor Victoria!\n",
      "Joey Ok all right, no, no, no, no, I do, I do, I do, I need your help, but Chandler I don�t know if I can take anymore\n",
      "Chandler Oh, not with my combination of ice cubes, aloe Vera and my gentle self-loathing touch.\n",
      "Monica \"Take me to the mansion in the sky-y\". I am sorry, the song is over. Did you see me out there?\n",
      "Phoebe Every little bit of you!\n",
      "Monica I can�t believe I did this. I can�t believe I'm singing for the people, and they liked me! Hey, did you hear that\n",
      "Mike Sure.\n",
      "Phoebe Mon', not that you didn�t sound good, but...\n",
      "Monica Good? Didn�t you hear them...I was great! Thank you so much for making me do this. That�s is the best gift ever.\n",
      "Mike Also a good gift? Underwear.\n",
      "Michelle Thank you so much for letting me do this. Public bathrooms freak me out, I can't even pee, let alone do\n",
      "Ross But, what�s great is that you don�t mind talking about it.\n",
      "Michelle It�s so amazing I met you the same day that Eric broke up with me, because it�s like you lose a boyfriend,\n",
      "Ross Uh-ah!\n",
      "Michelle No don�t worry, this is not some rebound thing. I am totally over Eric.\n",
      "Ross (pfew). Good choice Ross.\n",
      "Rachel Oh, hey! Hi, there you are, I�ve been looking for you everywhere!\n",
      "Ross Oh, yeah, hello, well, now, here I am.\n",
      "Rachel Listen, my mum is not bringing the baby back until nine o� clock. So I was hoping you and I could have a\n",
      "Ross Oh, yeah, yeah that�s Michelle.\n",
      "Rachel Who?\n",
      "Ross Oh, just this woman I�ve been seeing.\n",
      "Rachel You�ve being seeing someone?\n",
      "Ross Yeah, didn�t I mention that? Yeah, I mean, we haven�t being going out for too long, but rather there is this\n",
      "Michelle What are you taking amoxicillin for?\n",
      "Ross How great is this? You are already comfortable enough to look through my stuff. Oh, I am sorry Michelle, that�s\n",
      "Rachel Hi, and I am also Emma�s mother.\n",
      "Michelle Ah, who is Emma?\n",
      "Ross I told you about my daughter.\n",
      "Michelle This is your daughter? I can be your new mummy!\n",
      "Chandler And done!\n",
      "Joey Oh my God! I didn�t feel a thing ! Hey, are you still looking for a job because you can tweeze circles around\n",
      "Chandler Thanks. You wanna see what it looks like?\n",
      "Joey Yeah, yeah. Hey, they totally match! They look great! They look great! How you doing!\n",
      "Chandler Yeah, yeah, I think it looks pretty good. I was a little worried I was uncovering a birthmark right about\n",
      "Joey Thank you so much.\n",
      "Chandler No problem.\n",
      "Joey Listen that�s a pretty girly hour we just spent, we should add some manly make up for it.\n",
      "Chandler Yeah.\n",
      "Joey Comb my eyelashes.\n",
      "Monica Ok, for my next song I think I�ll sing something a little more upbeat. All right? Oh, how about the Pointer\n",
      "Phoebe Oh you�ll probably take care of that on your hands.\n",
      "Chandler I am sorry I am late. You�ll understand when you�ll see Joey.\n",
      "Monica Honey, you�re just in time, I�m about to sing another song!\n",
      "Chandler Really? In front of all this people?\n",
      "Monica And they love me!\n",
      "Chandler Oh my God!\n",
      "Phoebe Yes, she gives the people what they want.\n",
      "Monica All right, watch!\n",
      "Monica \"Tonight's the night we're gonna make it happen, tonight we'll put all other things aside. Give in this\n",
      "Chandler Are those my wife�s nipples?\n",
      "Phoebe Oh? Isn�t that funny? I didn't see that before, I wouldn't have let her go up again.\n",
      "Chandler I gotta stop this.\n",
      "Monica Oh, who cares, they still love me! \"I am so excited...\"\n",
      "Chandler You, touching yourself, out!\n",
      "Rachel Wow. She does that a lot!\n",
      "Michelle Ross, you didn�t tell me you were a doctor!\n",
      "Rachel What, what, wait a minute! You haven�t even told her you were a doctor, yet? How long have you known her, like\n",
      "Michelle Actually about an hour and a half.\n",
      "Ross I told you it wasn�t long, but there is an amazing connection between us.\n",
      "Michelle You feel that too? Oh, I thought that was just me!\n",
      "Ross Are you kidding?\n",
      "Michelle Hey, do you want to go away this weekend?\n",
      "Ross We�ll see.\n",
      "Rachel Ok, Ross, what�s going on here, are we just bringing strange women back to the apartment now?\n",
      "Ross I don�t know, are we just kissing guys on balconies?\n",
      "Rachel How do you know about that?\n",
      "Ross Through the magic of sight! I was here, putting our child to sleep...\n",
      "Michelle Emma.\n",
      "Ross When I happened to look through the window and I see you kissing a guy you know, for what? A week?\n",
      "Rachel Oh, that�s what this is all about? Did you bring her up here to get back at me?\n",
      "Michelle No, actually, see I had to pee, �cause I can�t use public bathrooms because the doodie parasites.\n",
      "Ross Ok, Michelle, it�s time to go.\n",
      "Michelle Well, call me!\n",
      "Ross Ok.\n",
      "Michelle No, wait, you don�t have my phone number!\n",
      "Ross You know, if it�s meant to be, I�ll guess it. Bye, bye.\n",
      "Rachel Score.\n",
      "Ross Oh, I am sorry, did you not like her, because I was hoping that we could come to one of your kissing parties on\n",
      "Rachel Oh God, I can�t believe you�re making such a big deal about this. It was one kiss, one guy, one time!\n",
      "Ross Oh, really!\n",
      "Rachel Yeah.\n",
      "Ross Oh, really!\n",
      "Rachel Oh yeah.\n",
      "Ross What about the guy from the bar?\n",
      "Rachel What? Who?\n",
      "Ross The guy you gave your number to.\n",
      "Rachel Whoa, how do you know about that?\n",
      "Ross Because he called here looking for you. So don�t tell me this...this kissing this guy from work is a one time thing,\n",
      "Rachel Why didn�t I get that message?\n",
      "Ross What?\n",
      "Rachel From the guy in the bar, why didn�t I get that message?\n",
      "Ross Because I folded it up and put in my pants pocket. Do you...do you not look there?\n",
      "Rachel Ross?\n",
      "Ross I never gave it to you.\n",
      "Rachel Why?\n",
      "Ross I don�t know.\n",

      "Rachel Yes.\n",
      "Ross I am the guy who�s taking care of our baby while you�re out at bars meeting guys!\n",
      "Rachel Oh my God, I cannot believe this. You know I actually came in here hoping to have a mature conversation with you\n",
      "Ross None of the sane ones wanted to come back with me! That�s not the point. Ok? The point is you...you are the one\n",
      "Rachel Oh, Ross, this is just so messed up! What�s wrong with us? You know when people hear about our situation they\n",
      "Ross Uh, clearly.\n",
      "Rachel And you know, we said that we would, we would live together as long as this makes sense. An maybe this, you know,\n",

      "Joey Hey!\n",

      "Joey Well, I'm totally over it Chandler. Friends forever! Don't come out here!\n",
      "A Tourist (To Joey) Would you mind doing a picture with us?\n",
      "Chandler Uh, what was that?\n",
      "Joey Uh, Entertainment Tonight. [Cut to Chandler] Yeah, okay so, good talking to ya and don't come out here. All right. (Hangs up the phone and poses for that picture.)\n",
      "Phoebe Monica! I'm sorry I'm late! (Starts looking around for her) Monica? (Goes into Monica's bedroom.)\n",
      "Monica (entering) Phoebe? (Phoebe comes back into the living room) Oh, Phoebe, I'm so sorry. Have you been here long?\n",
      "Phoebe (saddened) It's okay. What the hell took you so long?\n",
      "Monica Okay, you can not tell Chandler. Okay? That I ran into Richard.\n",
      "Phoebe Which Richard?\n",
      "Monica The Richard.\n",
      "Phoebe Richard Simmons?! Oh my God!\n",
      "Monica Noo! My ex-boyfriend Richard! Y'know the tall guy, moustache?\n",
      "Phoebe Oh! Okay, that actually makes more sense. So how was it?\n",
      "Monica It was, it was really nice. We started talking and I-I ended up having lunch with him.\n",
      "Phoebe That is so weird! I had a dream that you'd have lunch with Richard.\n",
      "Monica Really?\n",
      "Phoebe But again, Simmons. Go on.\n",
      "Monica The strange part was, he was really nice, umm and he looks great, but I didn't feel anything at all!\n",
      "Phoebe Ooh! So now why can't we tell Chandler?\n",
      "Monica Because it would totally freak him out and tomorrow's our anniversary. I just don't want anything to spoil that.\n",
      "Phoebe Oh, I can't believe you guys lasted a whole year!\n",
      "Monica I know.\n",
      "Phoebe Wow! I owe Rachel 20 bucks!\n",
      "Monica What?\n",
      "Phoebe On a totally different bet.\n",
      "Chandler (entering) Hey!\n",
      "Monica It's almost our anniversary!\n",
      "Chandler I know. Can you believe it? One year ago today I was just your annoying friend Chandler.\n",
      "Phoebe Awww! Now you're just my annoying friend Chandler.\n",
      "Chandler Huh.\n",
      "Monica I got you a present!\n",
      "Chandler Oh, but it's not 'til tomorrow!\n",
      "Monica I know, but you have to open it today! (Hands it too him.)\n",
      "Chandler Okay.\n",
      "Monica (grabbing the gift from him and opening it) Okay! There you go! It's two tickets to Vegas!\n",
      "Chandler Wow!\n",
      "Monica For this weekend! Oh gosh, it would be perfect, we get to see Joey plus we get to start our anniversary celebration on the plane. We can call it out plane-aversary.\n",
      "Chandler Do we have to?\n",
      "Monica No.\n",
      "Chandler Okay this is great, but Joey said he didn't want any of us out there.\n",
      "Monica Oh, he just doesn't want us to go through any trouble. Think of how excited he'll be when we go out and surprise him! Plus we get to have our own, ani-Vegas-ary! A-Nevadaversary!\n",
      "Chandler Yeah, I think we should see other people.\n",
      "Monica But we can go, right?\n",
      "Chandler Yes.\n",
      "Monica Okay!\n",
      "Chandler It's a great idea. (They kiss)\n",
      "Phoebe Okay, I'm gonna go too!\n",
      "Chandler Y'know Pheebs, it's kinda our (His and Monica's) anniversary.\n",
      "Phoebe Oh please, you are not gonna ditch again like you did with London.\n",
      "Monica Ditch you? Phoebe, you were pregnant with the triplets!\n",
      "Phoebe Uh-huh, great story! I'm going!\n",
      "Rachel (entering with Ross) Hi!\n",
      "Phoebe Hey!\n",
      "Ross Hey!\n",
      "Phoebe Hey, you guys, listen, this weekend we're all gonna go to Las Vegas to surprise Joey! Including me!! You wanna go?!\n",
      "Rachel Well, I guess I could take a couple days off work.\n",
      "Phoebe Of course you can take a couple days off work because this trip includes me!\n",
      "Rachel Oh no, wait a minute, wait, I've got a presentation tomorrow. I can't miss that.\n",
      "Ross Oh, but I've got tickets to the Van Gogh exhibit! I've been waiting like a year for this.\n",
      "Chandler (coughing) Art lover!\n",
      "Ross What'd you say?\n",
      "Chandler I said art lover.\n",
      "Ross Is that supposed to be an insult?\n",
      "Chandler I don't know, I'm very tired.\n",
      "Ross So Rach, maybe you and I could fly out together Saturday.\n",
      "Rachel That sounds great.\n",
      "Ross Yeah? All right I'll call the airlines. (Picks up the phone and does so)\n",
      "Rachel Okay. Yeah, that would be nice actually, to have the apartment to myself for a night.\n",
      "Phoebe Oh yeah, so you can walk around naked.\n",
      "Rachel No! So I can be by myself. Y'know? Have a little alone time.\n",
      "Phoebe Naked alone time.\n",
      "Rachel No! Phoebe just because I'm alone doesn’t mean I wanna walk around naked. I mean, you live alone, you don't walk around naked.\n",
      "Phoebe Uh-huh! Why do you think it takes me so long to answer the door?\n",
      "Phoebe So, so far is this trip to Vegas better or worse than the trip to London?\n",
      "Chandler So it's pretty much the same Pheebs.\n",
      "Phoebe Okay, what about after I give you these candies? (Hands them each one from her purse.)\n",
      "Chandler Yeah, I guess it's a little better now.\n",
      "Phoebe Ah-ha! Okay, (takes out a notepad) Las Vegas 1, London 0! I'll be right back. (Gets up and heads aft.)\n",
      "Chandler (To Monica) Happy plane-aversary.\n",

      "Monica Okay!\n",
      "Chandler Okay! (He grabs his carryon and starts rummaging through it.) Oh man! Don’t tell me I did this!\n",
      "Monica I love the \"I forgot the present\" fake out!\n",
      "Chandler How do you feel about the, \"I really did forgot the present, please forgive me\" not fake out?\n",
      "Monica Oh that's okay. Don’t worry about it, you can give it to me when we get back.\n",
      "Chandler Ohh that's the worse thing that can happen on an anniversary ever!\n",
      "Phoebe (sitting down) Oh good! All right, so you decided to tell him about the Richard thing.\n",
      "Chandler What-what Richard thing?\n",
      "Phoebe Oh no. [The patented version.]\n",
      "Chandler What Richard thing?\n",
      "Phoebe (To Monica under her breath) Simmons! Go with Simmons!\n",
      "Monica Okay, I umm, I ran into Richard yesterday and he asked me if I wanted to go for a bite and I did. The only reason I didn't tell you is because I knew you'd get mad and I didn't want to spoil our anniversary.\n",
      "Chandler (talking out of the side of his mouth) I'm not mad.\n",
      "Monica Really?!\n",
      "Chandler Oh yeah! Yeah, so you-you bumped into Richard! You grabbed a bite! It's no big deal. (He still ain't happy.)\n",
      "Monica Great!\n",
      "Phoebe Okay, London 1…\n",
      "Rachel (takes off her robe) Oh! Look what happened! {Don't get your hopes up guys, we only get to see her from the back or from the neck up. Its times like these I wish that the networks would broadcast some nudity other than Denis Franz's butt.} (In her head.) Huh, check me out! I'm in my kitchen…naked! I'm picking up an orange. (Does so) I'm naked! (Goes into the living room) Lighting the candles, naked, and carefully. (She backs anything that might have a point like a candle on her body away.)\n",
      "Ross (in his head) Oh my God! That's Rachel naked! I can't look at that! I am looking at this. (Looks back at his book.) Okay, vivid colors, expressive brush strokes—Unless she wants me to be looking at that. She knows I'm home. She knows I can see her. What kind of game is she playing? I think maybe someone's lonely tonight. Oh-ho, Dr. Geller! Stop it! You're being silly! Or, am I?\n",
      "Rachel (singing) Love to love ya baby! Ow! Love to love ya baby! Ow! (There's a knock on the door, she turns off the music, puts on her robe, and goes to answer the door.) Love to love ya, baby! (There's another knock.) Darnit! (Looks through the peephole and turns on the lights.) Ugh. (She opens the door to Ross who's leaning against the door jam.)\n",
      "Ross Hey.\n",
      "Ross May I come in?\n",
      "Rachel Uh, yeah, if you want too.\n",
      "Ross Do you want me too?\n",
      "Rachel Yeah, sure?\n",
      "Ross So do I. (Slowly walks in.) Okay Rach, before anything happens (He takes off his coat) I just want to lay down a couple of ground rules. (Turns back to face her.) This is just about tonight. I don't to go through with this if it's going to raise the question of \"Us.\" (Rachel's confused) Okay? I just want this to be (Kicks off his left shoe) about what it is! (Kicks off the other one.)\n",
      "Rachel And um, what-what is that Ross?\n",
      "Ross The physical act of love. (Hisses at her.)\n",
      "Rachel (laughs) What?! Are you crazy?\n",
      "Ross Oh so-so you weren't trying to entice me just now with your-your nakedness?\n",
      "Rachel (gasps) Oh God, you saw me?! Oh!\n",
      "Ross You weren't trying to entice me with your nakedness.\n",
      "Rachel Noo!! No! You thought, you actually thought I wanted to have sex with you?!\n",
      "Ross No! No! (Grabs his coat) No! (Grabs a shoe.) No-no-no-no. (Grabs the other one and heads for the door.)\n",
      "Rachel Ohh wow! I’m sorry, but Ross you kicked off your shoes!\n",
      "Ross Can we, can we just forget this ever happened?\n",
      "Rachel Yes of course, absolutely! You're right. I'm sorry.\n",
      "Ross Thank you.\n",
      "Rachel Yes.\n",
      "Ross All right I guess I'm, gonna go pack. (Starts to leave)\n",
      "Rachel Okay. Oh wait! One more thing umm, do-do we still need to uh settle the question of \"us?\"\n",
      "Phoebe Hey you guys wait! Guys! (Catches up to them.) This place is so much better than London! Okay? This lady dressed like Cleopatra gave me a coupon, 99 cent steak and lobster dinner. Huh!\n",
      "Monica Phoebe, you don't eat animals.\n",
      "Phoebe For 99 cents, I'd eat you. (Sees the casino) Okay, I can totally settle down here. It's got everything I could ever want, including Joey! Look! (Points to Joey in his gladiator suit posing for a picture with two old ladies.) Oh! Look! Hi!\n",
      "Chandler Oh my God.\n",
      "Phoebe Hey! Joey! (They all head over to him, he spots them coming and panics.) Hey! Hey!! Wow! (She hugs him.)\n",
      "Joey Hi!\n",
      "Chandler Love your condoms my man.\n",
      "Joey What-what are you guys doing here? I thought I told you not to come.\n",
      "Phoebe Why are you dressed as a gladiator?\n",
      "Joey Uhh, because I'm shooting a scene right now. Yeah, I uh, I play a gladiator. Uh, y'know what? Hold-hold on a second. (To no one in particular) Can we cut? Yeah, my-my friends are here, I'm gonna take a little break.\n",
      "Monica Who are you talking too?\n",
      "Joey They uh director. Uhh, her. (Points to an old woman standing behind him. Who glares at him and walks off.) All right, all right, it's not a gladiator movie. I work here.\n",
      "Chandler Why?! What happened?!\n",
      "Joey Well, the movie got shutdown because they ran out of money, so I'm working here 'til it starts up again, if it ever does.\n",
      "Monica I'm so sorry.\n",
      "Joey Look, I'm sorry I didn't tell ya. (To Chandler) I'm sorry man.\n",
      "Chandler No-no, that's okay, apparently there's a new policy where we don't have to share everything with everybody.\n",
      "Monica I knew you were not okay with that.\n",
      "Phoebe So you're a gladiator! Wow!\n",
      "Joey Yeah, what-what's going on?\n",

      "Chandler No! Her boyfriend Richard!\n",
      "Monica It meant nothing! Okay? After all this time, how can you not trust me?\n",
      "Chandler When you go lunching with hunky moustache men and don't tell me about it!\n",
      "Monica You're right. I'm sorry. I should've told you.\n",
      "Chandler Thanks. (They hug.)\n",

      "Monica I can not see him? I mean, you can't tell me what to do!\n",
      "Chandler That's so funny, because I think I just did!\n",
      "Monica Oh y'know what? If you're gonna be acting like this all night, I really, I don't even want to be around you.\n",
      "Chandler Fine with me!\n",
      "Monica Fine! Happy Anniversary!\n",
      "Joey Whoa! Whoa! Guys! Please! Come on! Come on! This is obviously just a big misunderstanding.\n",

      "Joey Hey-hey don't look at me! I just work here! (Walks away.)\n",
      "Rachel (taking off her sweater) Okay umm, Ross? I'm-I'm really warm, so I'm going to be taking off my sweater. Now, I'm just letting you know that this is not an invitation to the physical act of love.\n",
      "Ross (sarcastic) Yep! That's hilarious!\n",
      "Rachel I'm sorry. I'm done. I'm done.\n",
      "Ross Y'know, last night was embarrassing for you too.\n",
      "Rachel No, not really. I mean you've seen me naked hundreds of times.\n",
      "Ross Uh-huh. But it was a first for the rest of my building.\n",
      "Rachel Okay. All right, that's true! But y'know I just don't embarrass that easily.\n",
      "Ross What?! You totally get embarrassed!\n",
      "Rachel No, I don't! Ross, I think I'm just a more secure person than you are.\n",
      "Ross Is that so?\n",
      "Rachel Yeah.\n",
      "Ross (loudly so that everyone can hear) Hey lady! I don't care how much you want it! Okay?! I am not gonna to have sex with you in the bathroom! (Rachel sinks lower on her chair trying to hide.)\n",

      "Rachel Ross, no! There is no way I am leaving this room looking like this!\n",
      "Ross Oh, come on! Rach, it's-it's not that bad.\n",
      "Rachel Ross, I am a human doodle!!\n",
      "Ross Look, just because some idiot drew on your face doesn't mean you shouldn't have any fun! Okay? And besides, hey-hey-hey no one is even gonna look at you. Okay? This is Vegas! Hello!

      "Monica I think so too.\n",
      "Phoebe Oh well, lost again. (She gets up and slowly moves away. The lurker scurries in and takes her spot, only this time Phoebe set a trap for her and catches her in the act.) That's it! You and me, outside!\n",
      "The Lurker I don't want to see you lose a chunk of that pretty blond hair!\n",
      "Phoebe Be cool! (They both pretend to have a nice conversation as the guard walks by, but after he leaves they both start fighting again.) Okay lady, your lurking days are over!\n",
      "The Lurker What?!\n",
      "Phoebe Yeah, from now on everyone you lurk, I'm gonna lurk first! You move on to someone else, I'm gonna be one step ahead of you, every single time! And then I'll be on your ass every hour of every day 'til Monday, because that's when I go home. When do you leave?\n",

      "Ross I'll do it. Hey, whatever you need me to do, I'm your man. (He starts to sit down on the bed. There's one problem though, he's about two feet to the left of it. Needless to say, he misses and falls on his butt.) (Looking up at Joey.) Whoa-oh-whoa! Are you, are you okay?\n",
      "Joey Yeah! I'm fine! Thanks! (He starts to leave, but gets an idea and stops.) Hey Rach, how you doin'?\n",

      "Rachel (bowing) Hello!\n",
      "Ross and Rachel (bowing) Hello!\n",

      "Joey (throws down a small wad of money, and as his hand twin starts to unfold it, Joey once again brings attention to their special gift to the world. {Y'know, looking at it now, they really don't have that similar of hands. Joey's are bigger.}) Ooh-ho-ho! (The dealer stares at him and he stops.)\n",

      "Rachel Well y’know, we would umm, repeat everything the other said, or uh, we’d jump out of closets to scare each other, or switch the sugar for the salt so they’d put salt on their cereal.\n",
      "Ben (laughs) That’s a good one.\n",
      "Rachel Yeah? You like that one?\n",
      "Ben Yeah, you’re funny.\n",
      "Rachel I’m funny? Oh thank God! Well hey, I’ve got a ton of these! Umm, oh hear—Do you want a good one? Here’s a good one. Umm, you uh, you take a quarter, take a quarter and, and you blacken the edge. Right? (Does so.) And then you say to person, I bet you can’t roll this quarter from your forehead to your chin without it leaving your face. And then when they do it, they’re left with a big black pencil line right down the center of their face.\n",
      "Ben Can I do it to you?\n",
      "Rachel Yeah, I-I-I-I’m funny Ben, but I’m not stupid. Okay?\n",
      "Joey So, did you uh, find anyone to marry you guys yet?\n",
      "Chandler No, but Horny for Monica Minister called, wanting to know if we were still together.\n",
      "Monica We’re never gonna find anybody.\n",
      "Joey Well then let me do it!\n",
      "Chandler Joe…\n",
      "Joey No-no-no! Look, I’ve been thinking about it. I’m an actor right? So I won’t get nervous talking in front of people.\n",
      "Monica Joey look it’s really sweet…\n",
      "Joey No-no-no-no look no! I won’t spit, and I won’t stare at Monica’s breasts! Y’know? Everyone knows I’m an ass man!\n",
      "Monica That is true.\n",
      "Joey Yeah and the most important thing is that it won’t be some like, stranger up there who barely knows you. It’ll be me! And I swear I’ll do a really good job. Plus, y’know I love you guys and-and it would really mean a lot to me.\n",
      "Chandler (To Monica) Y’know, we haven’t found anybody else.\n",
      "Monica It might be kinda cool.\n",
      "Joey So I can do it?\n",
      "Chandler Yeah you can do it.\n",
      "Joey All right!!! Okay!! All right! Okay-okay, I gotta get started on my speech! Oh, wait a minute, Internet ministers can still have sex right?\n",
      "Chandler Yeah.\n",
      "Joey Okay.\n",
      "Monica Hey Pheebs, how’s it going?\n",
      "Phoebe Oh, I have a headache. A horrible headache!\n",
      "Monica Oh, I’m sorry. Can I get you something?\n",
      "Phoebe Oh my God, you’ve got to stop chattering!\n",
      "Monica Here, take a couple of these. (She gets up to grab a couple of pills.)\n",
      "Phoebe What is it?\n",
      "Monica It’s Hexadrin.\n",
      "Phoebe Oh no, I don’t believe in Western medicine. No, if you just apply pressure to these points right here. (She’s pinching the bit of skin between her right thumb and forefinger with her left hand.) Then your hand starts to hurt and you still have a headache, so thanks. (Takes the pills.)\n",
      "Monica Okay, while we’re waiting for these pills to kick in, I’m gonna sit you down on the couch. Come on. (Phoebe gets up and goes with her.) Get some nice soft pillows under your head, I’m gonna turn the TV on and you can watch whatever you want. And I’m—Sit down—(She sits down on the couch)—gonna make you some tea. And then, I’m gonna rub your feet.\n",
      "Phoebe Oh.\n",
      "Joey Oh! My head! Oh! (He’s sitting on the chair, lies back, and puts his feet up for Monica to rub.) Oh!\n",
      "Rachel Coming.\n",
      "Ross I have a bone to pick with you.\n",
      "Rachel Uh-oh.\n",
      "Ross Yes! Ben learned a little trick.\n",
      "Rachel Oh yeah? Did he pull the old… (She is waving her hand up and down her face. She’s thinking about the pencil mark.)\n",
      "Ross That’s right! That’s right! Saran Wrap on the toilet seat so the pee goes everywhere!\n",
      "Rachel Oh that.\n",
      "Ross Yeah that! You know I hate practical jokes! They’re mean and they’re stupid and-and I don’t want my son learning them!\n",
      "Rachel Oh, come on! Saran Wrap on the toilet seat, you don’t think that’s just a little funny?!\n",
      "Ross I was barefoot. Now tell me, the toilet thing is the only thing you taught him right?\n",
      "Rachel (looking at his mark) Yes.\n",
      "Phoebe It’s amazing! My headache is completely gone! What are those pills called?\n",
      "Monica Hexadrin. (She gets the box out of her purse.)\n",
      "Phoebe Oh, I love you Hexadrin! (She kisses the box.) Oh look! It comes with a story! (She pulls out the instructions and side affects paper.)\n",
      "Monica No Phoebe, those are like the side affects and stuff.\n",
      "Phoebe Say what?\n",
      "Monica Y’know, the possible side affects.\n",
      "Phoebe Oh my God! (Starts reading them.) Dizziness, nervousness, drowsiness, facial swelling, nausea, headache—Headache. Vomiting, stomach bleeding, liver damage! Now okay, I don’t recall any of this coming up when you gave me these little death capsules! Oh I’m sorry, extra strength death capsules!\n",
      "Monica Phoebe, relax none of that stuff ever happens! They just put it on there for legal reasons!\n",
      "Phoebe Why?\n",
      "Monica In case it happens.\n",
      "Joey (entering) Hey!\n",
      "Chandler Hey!\n",
      "Joey Say hello to Reverend Joey Tribbiani! (Holds up the piece of paper bearing the proof of his ordination.)\n",
      "Chandler Hey!\n",
      "Monica You did it! You got ordained?!\n",
      "Joey Yeah, I just got off the Internet! Man, there is a lot of porn out there!\n",
      "Chandler Our minister…\n",
      "Phoebe I have liver damage. Ow! Oh! (She grabs the left side of her torso.)\n",
      "Monica Phoebe, your liver is right here. (She points to the right side of her torso.)\n",
      "Phoebe Okay, then I must be disoriented.\n",
      "Joey Anyway, I started working on what I’m going to say for the ceremony, do you wanna hear it?\n",
      "Chandler Okay.\n",
      "Monica Yeah!\n",
      "Joey Now-now, listen this is just a first draft so… (Starts to read the piece of paper he brought.) \"We are gathered here today on this joyous occasion to celebrate the special love that Monica and Chandler share.\" (Monica and Chandler like it so far.) Eh? (He continues reading.) \"It is a love based on giving and receiving. As well as having and sharing. And the love that they give and have is shared and received. And through this having and giving and sharing and receiving.\" (Phoebe nods her approval.) \"We too can share and love and have and receive.\"\n",
      "Chandler (To Monica) Should we call the spitter?\n",
      "Carol Hey Rachel! (The camera cuts to her face and we see that Ben pulled the quarter trick with her as well.)\n",
      "Rachel Hi!\n",
      "Carol What a nice surprise! What are you doing here?\n",
      "Rachel Well y’know I was just in the neighborhood and I passed by your building and I thought to myself, \"What’s up with Carol and sweet, little Ben?\"\n",
      "Carol Can I ask what—Come on in.\n",
      "Rachel Okay.\n",
      "Carol Umm uh, I’ll make some coffee and we can uh, chat.\n",
      "Rachel I’d love that. I would loooove… (Carol goes to make the coffee and she sits down.) So uh, so where is sweet little Ben? I would love to have a little...\n",
      "Ben (jumping up from behind her chair) Gotcha!! (Rachel jumps up startled.)\n",
      "Rachel I found him! (To Ben) Very funny, come here! (She sits down on the coffee table and Ben walks up.) That is exactly why I’ve come here to talk to you okay?\n",
      "Carol (from the kitchen) Rach, do you want some sugar in your coffee?\n",
      "Rachel Yes oh—(To Ben)—Do I want sugar in my coffee? (Ben nods no.) No, just some milk would be good Carol. Thanks. (To Ben) Okay, do you remember all that stuff I taught you yesterday?\n",
      "Ben (mimicking her) Remember all that stuff I taught you yesterday?\n",
      "Rachel Don’t do that.\n",
      "Ben Don’t do that.\n",
      "Rachel Seriously, your dad doesn’t like pranks.\n",
      "Ben Seriously, your dad doesn’t like pranks.\n",
      "Rachel Oh damnit!\n",
      "Ben Oh damnit!\n",
      "Rachel No! Don’t say that! Don’t say that!\n",
      "Ben Damnit!\n",
      "Rachel No don’t! Go back to repeating!\n",
      "Ben Damnit!\n",
      "Rachel Oh crap!\n",
      "Ben Oh crap!\n",
      "Phoebe I feel like my face is swelling. (To Monica) Is my face swelling?\n",
      "Monica Phoebe, your face is fine! Come on, none of this stuff is going to happen to you! Stop being such a baby!\n",
      "Phoebe Oh, interesting you should call me that! Now that I may never have one! (Holds up the warning label.)\n",
      "Joey Okay you guys, I got a little more written. Are you ready?\n",
      "Chandler Yeah. O-okay.\n",
      "Joey (reading) \"When I think of the love that these two givers and receivers share, I can not help but envy the lifetime ahead of having and loving and giving and…\" And then I can’t think of a good word for right here. (He points to the stop on the paper where he left off.)\n",
      "Monica How about receiving?\n",
      "Joey Yes!\n",
      "Chandler See Joe, not that that’s not grrreat! But, one of the cool things about having somebody we know perform the ceremony is that it can be about us! Y’know, it can be more personal. You can tell stories about us!\n",
      "Joey Ooh, like the time you and I went to Atlantic City and I made you laugh so hard you threw up your whole steak?! Remember?\n",
      "Chandler No, not us… (Motions Joey and him.) Us! (Motions Monica and him.)\n",
      "Monica I gotcha. Sorry. (To Monica) So, did you ever make him throw up a whole anything?\n",
      "Phoebe Did you ever feed him a poison capsule that made him bleed from the eyes?\n",
      "Monica It doesn’t say that!\n",
      "Phoebe Oh! Suddenly somebody knows all about the side affects!\n",
      "Chandler See Joe, we want you to tell stories but y’know, romantic stories. Nice stories.\n",
      "Joey Oh. Okay. Ooh! Ooh! Okay, maybe I’ll talk about London! Y’know when you two hooked up! Only, only I won’t say hooked up. I’ll say, \"Began their beautiful journey…\"\n",
      "Monica There you go!\n",
      "Joey \"…by doin’ it.\"\n",
      "Chandler Joe?\n",
      "Joey Okay. All right. Umm, so uh, so how did it happen? Did your eyes meet across the room? And then the next thing y’know you’re in the bathtub together and she’s feeding you strawberries?\n",
      "Chandler Isn’t that what happened with you and the bride’s maid?\n",
      "Joey Yeah!! I call that London style.\n",
      "Monica No that is not what happened with us. Well, I was umm, I was really sad that night because this guy that I was Ross’s mom.\n",
      "Joey Oh.\n",
      "Monica And then Chandler was, was really sweet and he consoled me. And well we drank too much…\n",
      "Joey Yeah baby!\n",
      "Chandler And I was a perfect gentleman and I walked her to her hotel room and said goodnight.\n",
      "Joey Oh.\n",
      "Chandler But then later that night…\n",
      "Joey Yeah baby!\n",
      "Chandler (answering the door) Hey!\n",
      "Monica (standing outside) Cute PJ’s! You’re really livin’ it up here in London huh?\n",
      "Chandler Well I was… I was exactly expecting company after…(He looks at his watch.) 9:15.\n",
      "Monica (entering) Is Joey here?\n",
      "Chandler Well, last time I saw him he was heading out the door with the bride’s maid and a bucket of strawberries. So uh, you’re not still upset about what that guy told ya are ya?\n",
      "Monica Wouldn’t you be?\n",
      "Chandler Well, look it’s been a really emotional time y’know, and you’ve had a lot to drink. And you’ve just got to let that go okay? I mean you were the most beautiful in the room tonight!\n",
      "Monica Really?\n",
      "Chandler You kidding? You’re the most beautiful woman in most rooms… (She jumps up and kisses him.) (Breaking the kiss.) Whoa! Whoa! Whoa! What’s going on? You and I just made out! You and I are making out?\n",
      "Monica Well, not anymore.\n",
      "Chandler But we don’t do that.\n",
      "Monica I know, I just thought it would be fun.\n",
      "Chandler How drunk are you?\n",
      "Monica Drunk enough to know that I want to do this. Not so drunk that you should feel guilty about taking advantage.\n",
      "Chandler (thinks) That’s the perfect amount!\n",
      "Monica Okay!\n",
      "Monica (breaking the kiss) Y’know what’s weird?\n",
      "Chandler What?\n",

It could never have worked like you guys did, ‘cause you guys are perfect for each other. Y’know, we look at you and-and we see you together and it just…it-it fits. Y’know?

      "Roy, the male stripper (coughs) Whoo, that's a lot of stairs!\n",
      "Roy Ooh, boy. You should warn people there's no elevator! I should not have had that Mexican food for lunch.\n",

      "Phoebe Oh, God!\n",
      "Roy All right, somebody show me where to plug in my box, and we'll get this party started! (he thrusts his pelvis towards Phoebe) Whaaaa... (walks back to plug in his cd player) Here? All right.\n",
      "Phoebe Rachel?\n",
      "Rachel Yeah?\n",
      "Phoebe Are you kidding?\n",
      "Rachel All right, look, we did not know that you wanted a stripper so we went to the phonebook and we got the first name we could find!\n",
      "Phoebe How old is your phonebook?\n",
      "Monica Oh my God, this man is gonna get naked in my apartment!\n",
      "Phoebe Oh God no, I don't wanna see him take his clothes off!\n",
      "Roy Are you talking about me?\n",
      "Monica Oh, no! I mean, obviously we want to see you take your clothes off! You big piece of eye candy!\n",
      "Roy Ok, ok, ladies! Can I have your attention, please? (pause) Did someone call for the long arm of the law? (He extends his arm from around his crotch and then upward and outward, towards Phoebe) I should warn you, I have a concealed weapon! (Puts his hands over his crotch) I hope you're familiar with the States penal code, ok, ok, enough teasing. Now for some pleasing!\n",
      "Roy Whoa, whoa, whoa (he turn off the music). She cringed!\n",
      "Phoebe This is how I look when I'm turned on!\n",
      "Roy You were talking about me before! Look, I don't need this! I'm outta here! Where's my hat? (goes to get it) Look, I've been in this business for a long time!\n",
      "Phoebe Shocking!\n",
      "Roy Now if you just pay me my three hundred dollars, I'll be on my way!\n",
      "Phoebe Three hundred dollars, are you kidding?\n",
      "Rachel No, that's ok, let's me just get my check book!\n",
      "Phoebe No, you're not gonna pay him, he didn't do anything!\n",
      "Roy Didn't do anything? I took a bus all the way from Hoboken. I climbed ... I dunno... like a billion stairs... It's not like I can take them two at a time!\n",
      "Phoebe I don't care. We're not paying you 300 dollars for this.\n",
      "Roy Well, look - it's not my fault if you're too uptight to appreciate the male form in all it's glory.\n",
      "Phoebe Oh yeah, okay. I'm uptight. Yeah, that's why I don't want to watch a middle aged guy dance around in what I can only assume is a child halloween costume! (turns to look at Monica and Rachel who look like they feel very sorry for the stripper)\n",
      "Roy I may have borrowed this from my nephew, but let me assure you, what's underneath (points at his groin)... is all man.\n",
      "Phoebe I'm sorry, did you say all man or old man?\n",
      "Roy (making a crying face) Oh, you're mean!\n",
      "Monica (walks towards Phoebe and the stripper) Uh, look, officer... uhm Sir...\n",
      "Roy Damnit. OH! (To Phoebe) Big surprise! The hunk of beef has feelings!\n",
      "Donny Ok Henrietta, you've picked Jack and Jill went up the hill.\n",
      "Joey (To Henrietta) My friend Rachel has a kid. I totally know nursery rhymes! (makes a thumbs up sign)\n",
      "Donny Joey describe these things associated with the United States congress. (Joey goes form looking very confident to looking very shocked the instant the word congress is said) Give me 20 seconds on the clock please. Ready? Go!\n",
      "Joey Oh, .. uh... uh... pass. (Next word: \"Rotunda\") Pass. (Next word: \"Filibuster\" stares at it a moment) Pass. (Henrietta is looking very confused) (Next word: \"Addendum\" 4 seconds remaining) Okay, the little thing that hangs down at the back of your throat.\n",
      "Henrietta Uvula!\n",
      "Joey Oh, then pass. (Next word: \"Joint session\", but time's up, Joey acts very disappointed)\n",
      "Donny O-kay... Henrietta, you didn't get all the points you needed, so that means Gene, you are going to the winners circle to try for ten thousand dollars! (Gene is clapping his hands looking very happy and so is Joey) And you're gonna be going there with Joey Tribbiani (Both of their smiles fade away instantly)\n",
      "Ross (To Chandler) You made out with Missy Goldberg. How could you do that, after you promised me?\n",
      "Chandler (to the two guys) Excuse me. (Chandler and Ross move away from them). That didn't make us sound gay at all!\n",
      "Ross You broke the pact!\n",
      "Chandler Ross, that was 16 years ago!\n",
      "Ross That doesn't matter! We're talking about the foundation of our friendship.\n",
      "Chandler I believe the foundation of our friendship was unfortunate hair. (Ross just stares at him) All right, look, if we're really gonna do this... it's not like you never broke one of the pacts.\n",
      "Ross I didn't.\n",
      "Chandler Oh really?\n",
      "Ross No.\n",
      "Chandler Oh really!?\n",
      "Ross NO!\n",
      "Chandler ADRIENNE TURNER!! (A girl behind them turns around)\n",
      "Adrienne Yes?\n",
      "Chandler and Ross Hey! Hey Adrienne. (They move away from her)\n",
      "Ross I never did anything with Adrienne Turner.\n",
      "Chandler Oh please, and you knew how much I liked her.\n",
      "Ross I don't know what... you're talking about.\n",
      "Chandler Really?\n",
      "Present Chandler's voice Remember that big party? Freshman year? A week before Christmas vacation? I do. You had some visitors.\n",
      "Monica I can't believe we are at a real college party! (Rachel laughs excitedly) I have to pee so bad!\n",
      "Rachel This is so awesome! College guys are so cute!\n",
      "Monica Hey, you've got a boyfriend!\n",
      "Rachel I know. But if some guy who looks like Corey Haim wants to kiss me tonight, I'm sooo gonna let them! (They spot Chandler)\n",
      "Monica Look, there's Chandler. You knew, that stupid friend of Ross'. Said I'm fat. You know I've already lost 4 pounds!\n",
      "Rachel It... You can so totally tell.\n",
      "Monica I KNOW!\n",
      "Rachel Well lets see. Maybe he knows where Ross is. (They walk towards Chandler) Hey, how's it going (tries to look as un-interested in him as possible - checking out her nails).\n",
      "Chandler Aren't you...?\n",
      "Rachel Yeah, Rachel. And this (points to Monica) is Ross' sister, Monica. We met at Thanksgiving. (looks around the room as if searching for something more interesting to do).\n",
      "Chandler (smiling at Monica) Right. (to Rachel) So how're you doing?\n",
      "Rachel Bitchin'\n",
      "Chandler Hi Monica.\n",
      "Monica Hi Chandler. It's really nice to see you (rolls her eyes) NOT. (she and Rachel giggle a little and Chandler looks unimpressed)\n",
      "Chandler O-kay. I'll see if I can find Ross. (Goes off to find Ross.)\n",
      "Monica Oh my God Rach. Bean bag chairs.\n",
      "Rachel Oh.\n",
      "Monica Do NOT let me sit in one of those. We'll be here for days.\n",
      "Ross Listen Adrienne, you can't tell Chandler about this.\n",
      "Adrienne Oh believe me, Ross, I won't be telling anybody about this.\n",
      "Ross Cool! (They start kissing again and Chandler looks shocked)\n",
      "Ross I didn't know you knew about that.\n",
      "Chandler Well, I did and it hurt. (they walk towards the bar) That's when I wrote the song: \"Betrayal In The Common Room\".\n",
      "Ross (looks disappointed in himself) Man... I... I'm sorry.\n",
      "Chandler Look (hands him a drink) it was a lo-o-ong time ago.\n",
      "Ross So, eh. I made out with Adrienne and you made out with Missy. Well I guess we're even.\n",
      "Chandler (smiling a little nervously) Hmm mmmhm..\n",
      "Ross We are even, right?\n",
      "Chandler (sighs) Just one more thing. I was so pissed at you that night that I wanted to get back at you. So I thought, who does Ross like the more than anybody?\n",
      "Ross (thinks about it for a few seconds) What did you do to my mom?\n",
      "Chandler Not her!\n",
      "Rachel I am sooo drunk.\n",
      "Monica That's weird. I've had the same number of beers as you and I don't feel anything at all. (Chandler approaches)\n",
      "Chandler Soo... you girls having fun?\n",
      "Monica For your information, ass munch, I've lost four pounds. Maybe even five with all the dancing. (A guy enters holding a pizza box)\n",
      "Pizza guy SOMEBODY ORDER A PIZZA?\n",
      "Monica Oh THATS ME! (she runs to the pizza guy)\n",
      "Rachel (finishing the last of her drink) I am soo not going to do good on my SATs tomorrow.\n",
      "Chandler Well maybe if you go to school here next year we can totally hang out.\n",
      "Rachel (sarcastic) Oh yeah. There is a plan! Why don't I just start taking my smart pills now?\n",
      "Chandler Well, maybe you can get in on a beauty scholarship.\n",
      "Rachel (blushing) Oh, what a line. (walks towards the drinks table with her back towards Chandler and whispers \"Oh my God!\")\n",
      "Chandler So where are you applying to?\n",
      "Rachel Oh well, You know, I think it's kinda really important that I go somewhere where there's sun, so I'm sort of... (Chandler leans in an kisses her) (She pulls away) Hey!\n",
      "Chandler I'm in college and I'm in a band.\n",
      "Rachel (She considers it for a second) Yeah okay. (She puts her hands around his neck and they start kissing again)\n",
      "Roy What's the matter? You never saw a 50 year old stripper cry before?\n",
      "Phoebe You know, it's fine. We'll pay you.\n",
      "Roy No, no, you're right. Who am I kidding? I should have hung up that breakaway jockstrap years ago. What am I gonna do? I mean, this has been my life for thirty two years. Taking my clothes off in front of people is all I know.\n",
      "Rachel No, wait. No there's gotta be something else that you can do. I mean, what skills do you have?\n",
      "Roy I don't know... I can make my pecs dance... I can pick up a dollar bill with my butt cheeks... I can go to that special place inside me where I feel no shame.\n",
      "Rachel So maybe something in an office.\n",
      "Phoebe Or you could teach stripping. You know, share your gift, pass the torch.\n",
      "Roy You know, actually that's not a bad idea. I can do it out of my apartment. I don't think my mom would mind.\n",
      "Phoebe There you go. Okay, do you think you're gonna be okay?\n",
      "Roy Yeah, yeah, yeah... This is so weird. I mean, you never know when it's gonna be your last dance. And I didn't even get a chance to finish it.\n",
      "Phoebe (after a pause) Finish it!\n",
      "Roy What?\n",
      "Phoebe Your last dance. Do it for us.\n",
      "Roy Really?\n",
      "Rachel (to Phoebe) Really?\n",
      "Phoebe Yeah, yeah. He deserves to do the thing he loves one last time.\n",
      "Roy Okay, all right... Get ready ladies!\n",

      "Chandler Yeah, but it was like a million years ago, so it doesn't matter.\n",
      "Ross Well, it matters to me.\n",
      "Chandler Why?\n",
      "Ross Because... the night you kissed Rachel was the night I kissed Rachel for the very first time.\n",
      "Chandler You kissed her that night too?\n",
      "Monica Two guys in one night? Wow, I thought she became a slut after she got her nose fixed.\n",
      "Chandler Seriously, where did this happen?\n",
      "Ross Okay, after you told me she was passed out in our room, I went in there to make sure she was all right. She was lying on my bed, all buried in peoples coats. Well, I went to kiss her on the forehead, you know. But it was so dark, I accidentally got her lips. I started to pull away, but then I felt her start to kiss me back. It was only for a second, but... it was amazing. And now, now I find out that you kissed her first.\n",
      "Chandler Oh wait... What bed did you say she was on?\n",
      "Ross Mine.\n",
      "Chandler I'm pretty sure I put her on my bed.\n",
      "Ross No, she was definitely on my bed.\n",

      "Ross No, NO! (they're moving to the side of the bed, where they sit down) Look, I need to talk to Joey. I mean, you guys just broke up. Before anything more happens between us, I need to know he's okay with it.\n",

      "Mike I'll tell her that it's over tonight at dinner. I promise.\n",
      "Phoebe Oh, okay... good. You do that. And then when you get home, maybe there'll be a special delivery package waiting for you.\n",
      "Mike Maybe I'll sign for it. Tear it open. Pull out the packing material...\n",
      "Phoebe You know what, we're gonna have sex. Let's just leave it there.\n",

      "Joey You kissed.\n",
      "Ross Wha... (gasps) What? What would give you that idea?\n",
      "Joey I saw you.\n",
      "Ross Yeah, we kissed, but... nothing else... nothing else happened, okay.\n",
      "Joey Ross, Ross, Ross... It's okay.\n",
      "Ross What?\n",
      "Joey It's okay. You know, I totally understand, alright? You guys, make way more sense than her and I ever did, you know. And... I want you to be happy.\n",
      "Ross Are you serious?\n",
      "Joey Yeah... Now I have something...\n",
      "Ross I am speachless... I mean the fact that you would put my happiness first like that. I mean, you're an incredible friend, you know that?\n",
      "Joey Oh... uh... look... before you...\n",
      "Ross No, I mean it. You are so loyal man, and selfless, and generous...\n",
      "Joey I am those things, yeah.\n",
      "Ross You know what? I know Chandler longer, so I always think of him as my best friend, but now... I may have to rethink some stuff...\n",
      "Joey Dude!\n",
      "Ross Hey, if there is ever, anything I can do for you...\n",
      "Joey I can't think of anything.\n",

      "Rachel Really? Excited?\n",
      "Ross Are you kidding? I have had some very dirty dreams about this...\n",
      "Rachel Excuse me! (and she walks back to Joey, who is still looking very impressed about what Ross said to him. Rachel looks at him and hits him.) You didn't tell him, did you?\n",
      "Joey I couldn't. He was saying all these really nice things about me. I didn't want him to get mad and take 'em all back. I'm on a edge on Chandler.\n",
      "Rachel Oh God! Alright, fine. You know what Joey, forget it. When we go back to New York, I will tell him.\n",
      "Joey Thank you. Yeah, I appreciate that.\n",
      "Phoebe Hi, Mike's place.\n",
      "Mike Hey, it's Mike.\n",
      "Phoebe Ooh, that was fast.\n",
      "Mike Oh, err... no, she's not here yet. You know, I think I'm just gonna take off and break up with her over the phone...\n",
      "Phoebe Yeah, you can't do that! Oh, come on Mike, strap on a pair.Why don't you just tell her that we got back together. You know, women appreciate honesty. We also appreciate gentle spanking once in a while. Just F.Y.I.\n",
      "Mike One more thing... There... might be a picture of Precious on my coffee table.\n",
      "Phoebe Her name is Precious? Is she a purebreed or did you pick her up at the pound?\n",
      "Mike Anyway, I just wanna give you a heads up.\n",
      "Phoebe Okay, oh and you know, if she gets upset, just scratch her tummy and give her a liver snout. (laughs and hangs up the phone)\n",
      "Precious Hi, I'm Precious, who are you?\n",
      "Phoebe (stunned) I... I'm Phoebe.\n",
      "Precious Phoebe? Mike's ex-girlfriend Phoebe, the love of his life? That Phoebe?\n",
      "Phoebe Enchanté (she holds out her hand, and they shake hands)\n",
      "Monica Oh, I can't wait for everyone at work to see these... (plays with her hair to make the shells tingle again) Ow!\n",
      "Chandler You go back to work tomorrow night, right?\n",
      "Monica Yeah!\n",
      "Chandler So if you want people to see them, then by definition you're not having them taken out... say, at the break of dawn?\n",
      "Monica Well, if I had them taken out, then I wouldn't be able to do this. (she pushes Chandler on the couch and brushes her hair and shells against Chandler's chest) You like that, right? (again, she brushes her hair against his chest and hums...)\n",
      "Chandler What are you singing?\n",
      "Monica It's \"Bolero\" from \"10\".\n",
      "Chandler It's \"Ride of the Valkyries\" from \"Apocalypse Now\"... See, here's the thing: The corn rose were really a solution to your frizzy hair problem. And now that we're home, we don't have that problem anymore, so if you think about it... I hate them!\n",
      "Monica You what? You said you liked them.\n",
      "Chandler Did I? Let's refresh. I believe what I said was that I could see your scalp.\n",
      "Monica Fine, so you don't like them. Everybody else does.\n",
      "Chandler Again, let's journey back... As I recall what Rachel said, was she had never notice the shape of your skull before. And Joey... Well, Joey didn't realise that there was anything different.\n",
      "Monica You know what? I don't care. I like it like this, and I'm gonna keep it. You're just jealous because your hair can't do this... (and she shakes her head more violently) OUCH!\n",
      "Chandler Hit yourself in the tooth?\n",
      "Monica And the eye!\n",
      "Ross (gasps) Hi... There she is. Hi Emma. Oh my God, I missed you. (kisses her) Oh Emma, I missed you so much. Hey... Did you have a good time with grandma Green? Huh? Did she give you a bottle of anti-depressants again to use as a rattle? (to Rachel)\n",
      "Rachel That was one time, Ross, and they were only like 5 milligrams.\n",
      "Ross Ooh hey, Emma, daddy has some presents for you okay? Okay? I want you to wait right here. Come here sweetie.\n",
      "Rachel Aaah... Ross, actually there's something that I really need to talk to you about.\n",
      "Ross (unpacking his bag) Okay, shoot!\n",
      "Rachel Okay, uhm... alright, here's the deal.\n",
      "Ross (gasps) OH NO!\n",
      "Rachel What? What is it?\n",
      "Ross Oh, major shampoo explosion!\n",
      "Rachel Uh, look Ross, this really isn't easy.\n",
      "Ross Oh, it's all over everything. Why? Why me? (looks up)\n",
      "Rachel Because you took three hundred bottles of shampoo?\n",
      "Ross I'm sorry, I'm sorry. You were saying?\n",
      "Rachel Well, yeah... Okay, look it's about me and...\n",
      "Ross Oh, not another one! Oh my G... And this is moisturiser. It's even harder to clean! Why? Why do bad things happen to good people?\n",
      "Rachel Wow! Well, clearly this is not a good time.\n",
      "Ross Duh, you think? (enters the kitchen)\n",
      "Phoebe Okay, bye. Alright, so Mike's on his way over. See, you thought you guys were meeting here, and he thought you were meeting at the restaurant, so you know... Doesn't really matter who's right or wrong. Point is... I'm gonna take off.\n",
      "Precious I'm not letting you leave until you tell me what's going on here. I mean, are you guys getting back together or something?\n",
      "Phoebe Alright... Susie, can I call you Susie?\n",
      "Precious My name is Precious.\n",
      "Phoebe Yeah, I can't say that. uhm... Susie, I'm gonna be straight with you... Mike and I are back together... and uhm... unfortunately that effectively ends your relationship with him. And he's very sorry about that and wishes you the best of luck in all your endeavours.\n",
      "Precious I just can't believe this... Why?\n",
      "Phoebe Well, I don't...\n",
      "Precious Oh, why would he do this? I mean, what's wrong with me?\n",
      "Phoebe Nothing, there's nothing wrong with you.\n",
      "Precious I mean, what the hell am I supposed to do now?\n",
      "Phoebe Damn it woman, pull yourself together! Have some pride, for the love of God.\n",
      "Phoebe Okay, not a fan of the tough love.\n",
      "Precious I just can't believe that Mike didn't give me any warning.\n",
      "Phoebe But he didn't really know, you know. He wasn't planning on coming to Barbados and proposing to me...\n",
      "Precious He proposed to you? This is the worst birthday ever. (she starts to cry again)\n",
      "Phoebe Look, Precious... Mike's not worth this. You're an attractive, intelligent woman and let's face it, Mike's kind of a wang. I mean, he proposed to me while he was still seeing you... He was gonna break-up with you on your birthday? And, I don't like to kiss-and-tell, but he cheated on you a lot this weekend.\n",
      "Precious Oh, my God, maybe you're right. Maybe I don't need him. I deserve to be treated with respect.\n",
      "Precious Screw you, Mike. You're a coward and a bastard, and I hope you rot in hell.\n",
      "Phoebe You're welcome!\n",
      "Chandler Honey, you've been in there for a long time... Is everything okay?\n",
      "Monica Not really.\n",
      "Monica I have a problem.\n",
      "Chandler Really? What happened?\n",
      "Monica Well, I was dancing around, and singing \"No Woman, No Cry\" and I got stuck.\n",
      "Chandler You can't move at all?\n",
      "Monica Oh, well, I can move... (she moves back and forth the shower curtain rail, opening and closing the shower curtain with her hair as she goes)\n",
      "Chandler If I untangle you, will you please get rid of the corn rose?\n",
      "Monica (looking disappointed) I guess so...\n",
      "Chandler (trying to untangle her) Some of these look a little frayed.\n",
      "Monica Yeah, I tried to gnaw myself free.\n",
      "Joey Hey!\n",
      "Rachel Hi!\n",
      "Joey So, did you err... did you tell Ross?\n",
      "Rachel Well, I tried, but then he had a shampoo related emergency. So I guess now it's your turn again.\n",
      "Joey No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no... I think it's better if you tell him, you know. It's easier for a woman. That way, you know, if he gets mad, all you have to do is go... I didn't mean it. I'm so so--ooory. (he pushes his breasts together from the side)\n",
      "Rachel Yeah, 'cause that's what we do.\n",
      "Joey Alright, alright, okay, uhm... How 'bout this, how about this? Tomorrow... tomorrow we'll both go and we'll tell him together.\n",
      "Rachel Okay, that sounds fair. It just means that once again we can't...\n",
      "Joey I know, I know..., but that's okay. I mean, we can control ourselves, we're not animals.\n",
      "Rachel No! Of course we can wait. Alright, so I guess that means good night then?\n",
      "Joey Yeah! Good night! (they give each other a small kiss on the mouth, and stare at each other for a while)\n",
      "Rachel Goo--ood night!\n",
      "Joey Good night! (they give each other a kiss again, but this time it lasts longer)\n",
      "Rachel Seriously, good night!\n",
      "Joey Stop saying good night.\n",
      "Rachel Okay.\n",
      "Monica Look what I found in the drawer... (Chandler looks up from his book.) And you said I'd never wear this...\n",
      "Chandler Now that I untangled you, how 'bout you doing a little something for me?\n",
      "Monica Sure, what do you have in mind?\n",
      "Chandler I think you know.\n",
      "Monica Really? I don't really feel like it.\n",
      "Chandler This is what I want to do.\n",
      "Monica Okay, I just don't get why you like it so much.\n",
      "Chandler (Picks up the \"Miss Congeniality\" DVD) She's an FBI agent, posing as a beauty contestant.\n",

      "Rachel Oh my God! This is it! (She and Phoebe hold hands.) (To Phoebe) I really hope it’s you!\n",
      "Phoebe I hope it’s you.\n",

      "Rachel Okay, bla-bla-bla-bla!! Who is it?!\n",
      "Monica Well umm, I was thinking that maybe we could come up with a system where we trade of being maid of honor for each other. Like hypothetically, if Phoebe were mine…\n",
      "Phoebe Yes!!! Oh!!\n",
      "Rachel Hypothetically!\n",
      "Phoebe Still.\n",
      "Monica If Phoebe were my maid of honor…\n",

      "Rachel Yeah that’s actually a pretty good idea.\n",

      "Monica (laughs) Well that’s the best part. Umm, you guys get to decide!\n",
      "Phoebe Wh-why is that the best part?\n",
      "Monica Because then I don’t have to!\n",
      "Rachel Well of course we will help you decide! We will do anything we can to help you! Now, I would like to make a toast, to the future Mrs. Chandler Bing (A woman at the table behind them overhears Chandler’s name and starts listening closer), my best friend, and truly one of the nicest people that…\n",

      "Phoebe But why does it even matter?!\n",
      "Rachel Why does it matter so much to you?!\n",
      "Phoebe Because this one is now! And-and it’s two of our best friends! Who knows what you’re gonna marry!\n",
      "Rachel What-what if I marry Ross—Or Joey?\n",
      "Phoebe (gasps) You wouldn’t! Okay look, Rachel I know you really want to do this, but I-I’ve never been maid of honor to anyone before! And I know you’ve done it at least twice!\n",
      "Rachel Yeah but Phoebe…\n",
      "Phoebe And no, oh please, oh please let me finish. (Rachel stops talking.) Oh I guess that was it.\n",
      "Rachel Okay. Okay. It’s—since you’ve never done it before you can be Monica’s made of honor.\n",

      "Ross I think that would be best.\n",
      "Joey Yeah. All right, I’ll talk to you later.\n",
      "Ross Okay. But not about this!\n",

      "Ross No touch! No touch!\n",
      "Monica Yeah hey, a weird thing happened today whey I was at brunch. This woman overheard that I was marrying you and-and then she…she wished me good luck.\n",
      "Chandler That’s sweet.\n",
      "Monica No, it’s more like a (sarcastically) good luck.\n",
      "Chandler So uh, what did this woman look like?\n",
      "Monica She was like 30, dark hair, attractive.\n",
      "Chandler Well, is there any chance you were looking into a bright, shiny thing called a mirror?\n",
      "Monica Come on, was it somebody maybe you dated in college?\n",
      "Chandler No, no I only dated two girls in college, both blonde, both not attractive… (Thinks a little while.) Hold on one second; let me check this out. (He gets up and grabs a photo album.\n",
      "Monica What are you doing?\n",
      "Chandler Well, let’s see… (Finding the picture he wants.) Okay uh, is that her? (Pointing to the picture.)\n",
      "Monica Oh my God yes! Who is she?\n",
      "Chandler Julie Grath, my camp girlfriend.\n",
      "Monica Did you break up with her?\n",
      "Chandler (pause) No, we’re still together. Yeah we went out for two summers, and then I broke up with her.\n",
      "Monica Why?\n",
      "Chandler Well, ‘cause she came back the third summer and she’d gotten really fa-aa-aw-ow…\n",
      "Monica Fat?!\n",
      "Chandler I did not say fat! I said, \"Fa-aa-aw-ow…\"\n",
      "Monica You broke up with a girl because she was fat?!\n",
      "Chandler Yeah. Yeah, but it was a really, really long time ago! Does she still feel bad?\n",
      "Monica Well, apparently she does.\n",
      "Chandler Well, you know what they say, elephants never forget. (Monica is not amused by that statement.) Seriously, good luck marrying me.\n",
      "Joey Hey! What’s going on?\n",
      "Rachel Phoebe is gonna be Monica’s maid of honor!\n",
      "Joey Hey! Well I hope it goes better than the last time you did it for that girl downstairs, remember? (Phoebe glares at him.)\n",
      "Rachel (shocked) You have been maid of honor before?!!\n",
      "Phoebe See? This is exactly why you shouldn’t lie!\n",
      "Rachel All right that’s it! I am maid of honor!\n",
      "Phoebe Na-uh, I am!\n",
      "Rachel How come you are?!\n",
      "Phoebe Because I cared enough to lie!\n",
      "Joey Hey-hey-hey-hey, I can help you decide who should do it! Yeah, we could have like uh, like an audition and see how you’d handle maid of honor type situations.\n",
      "Phoebe What are you talking about?\n",
      "Joey Like when I want a job, I go to an audition and if I’m the best of the people they see, they give me the part.\n",
      "Phoebe Okay, so after this audition, who decides who gets it?\n",
      "Joey Oh uh, me and Ross can be the judges.\n",
      "Phoebe (To Rachel) Well, it’s better than us deciding.\n",
      "Rachel Oh, come on! This is crazy! Can’t we just flip a coin?!\n",
      "Phoebe No! Coins hate me!\n",
      "Rachel Okay. Okay fine, y’know what? We will let Ross and Joey decide. (Ross enters.) (In a sexy voice.) Hiiiii, Ross! Sweetie.\n",
      "Phoebe Hey there, you handsome thing. (Rachel and Phoebe exit.)\n",
      "Ross Wow, this cologne really is every bit as good as Georgio.\n",
      "Joey Hi.\n",
      "Ross Just uh, brought back your videos.\n",
      "Joey Uh hey look uh Ross, look I think we need to talk about before.\n",
      "Ross No! No we don’t!\n",
      "Joey Yes we do! Now look, that was the best nap I ever had!!\n",
      "Ross I… I don’t know what you are talking about.\n",
      "Joey Come on! Admit it! That was the best nap you ever had!\n",
      "Ross I’ve had better.\n",
      "Joey Okay! When?!\n",
      "Ross All right! All right! It was the best nap ever!\n",
      "Joey Uh-huh!\n",
      "Ross I’ve said it! Okay?! But it’s over Joey!\n",
      "Joey I want to do it again.\n",
      "Ross We can’t do it again.\n",
      "Joey Why not?\n",
      "Ross Because it’s weird!\n",
      "Joey Fine! Do you want something to drink?\n",
      "Ross Sure, what do you got?\n",
      "Joey Warm milk and Excedrin P.M. (Ross just leaves.)\n",
      "Monica Chandler! (Knocks on the door.) Chandler! I just figured out who you are!\n",
      "Chandler Can you figure out what I’m doing?\n",
      "Monica You’re Lewis Posin.\n",
      "Chandler Who?\n",
      "Monica Lewis Posin! He was my best friend in fifth grade, and-and then one day I asked him to be my boyfriend and he said no. Do you know why?\n",
      "Chandler Because you kept talking to him while he was trying to go to the bathroom?!\n",
      "Monica No! But because he thought I was to faaaaa…. (Chandler emerges, without flushing by the way.) And every time I think about it, it makes me feel as bad as I did in fifth grade! Y’know, I-I really think that you should apologize to Julie.\n",
      "Chandler What? Are you kidding? That was like 16 years ago.\n",
      "Monica No, I know. But y’know what? It would make me feel better if Lewis apologized to me.\n",
      "Chandler Okay, I will do it. But I have to warn you; this may make me a better person and that is not the man you feel in love with!\n",
      "Joey Okay, all right, this is how it’s going to work. We’re gonna give you hypothetical maid of honor situations and you will be scored on a scale of 1 to 10, 1 being the highest.\n",
      "Ross No, 10 is the highest.\n",
      "Joey Why is 10 the highest?\n",
      "Ross Because it’s the highest. (Joey shrugs his shoulders) Okay, Rachel you’re up first. (Rachel stands up and gets ready.) Situation No. 1: You’re with Monica, the wedding is about to start when Monica gets cold feet. Go! (Joey is playing the part of Monica.)\n",
      "Joey (crying) I don’t want to marry Chandler!\n",
      "Rachel Okay, uh…\n",
      "Joey I’ve got cold feet.\n",
      "Rachel …it’s gonna be okay!\n",
      "Joey No, one man for the rest of my life? I don’t know if I can do it! This means I’ll never get to sleep with Joey!\n",
      "Rachel Look Monica, getting cold feet is very common. Y’know, it’s-it’s just because of all the anticipation and you just have to remember that you love Chandler. And also, I ran out on a wedding. You don’t get to keep the gifts.\n",
      "Joey (out of his Monica character) Very good! Drawing on your own experience, I like that!\n",
      "Rachel Thanks!\n",
      "Ross Yes, very nice Rachel.\n",
      "Rachel Thank you judges.\n",
      "Phoebe Ugh, what a kiss ass.\n",
      "Rachel Oh!\n",
      "Joey Okay, Phoebe…\n",
      "Phoebe Yes! Your honor?\n",
      "Joey We’re now in the ceremony, Monica is about to say, \"I do\" when her drunk uncle starts yelling. What do you do? Go!\n",
      "Ross (playing the drunk uncle) When Monica was a little girl, I remember that—(Phoebe screams and tackles him)—Ooh!! Ow! Very good!\n",
      "Phoebe Oh!\n",
      "Joey Yes! Excellent! Perfect score!\n",
      "Rachel Wait a minute! She just made a scene in the middle of the ceremony!\n",
      "Phoebe Hey! Do you want do you want a little taste of Pheebs?!\n",
      "Ross It is time for you to give your maid of honor speech.\n",
      "Rachel Ohh, wait a minute, we haven’t pre…\n",
      "Ross Go!\n",
      "Rachel Okay! Okay! Umm, Webster’s Dictionary defines marriage as… (Ross and Joey start writing.) Okay!! Forget that! That sucks!! Okay, never mind! Forget it! Umm, umm, okay, uh… I met, I-I met, I met Monica when we were just a couple of six year olds and I became friends with Chandler when he was 25, although he seemed like a six year old.\n",
      "Ross and Joey Oh! That’s nice.\n",
      "Rachel Thank you. Thank you very much. Umm, I’ve known them separately and I’ve known them together and-and to know them as a couple is to know that you are truly in the presence of love. So I would like to raise my glass (Grabs a glass and holds it up) to Monica and Chandler and the beautiful adventure they are about to embark upon together. I can think of no two people better prepared for the journey.\n",
      "Joey Wow. (To Ross) Good speech.\n",
      "Ross Yeah, it really was!\n",
      "Rachel Aw, thanks!\n",
      "Ross Okay Phoebe, I guess you’re next (To Joey) although I really don’t see the point.\n",
      "Joey Yeah.\n",
      "Phoebe Okay, I can’t believe that Monica and Chandler are getting married. I remember talking about this day with Rachel while we were showering together, naked. (Raises her glass and drinks.)\n",
      "Joey And she’s back in the game.\n",
      "Chandler (she opens the door) Julie hi! Chandler Bing, I, I guess you remember me.\n",
      "Julie Hello Skidmark.\n",
      "Chandler (To Monica) It’s a nickname, I’ll explain later.\n",
      "Monica It’s pretty clear.\n",
      "Chandler Ah, uh, I owe you a long overdue apology. I never should have broken up with you because you were overweight.\n",
      "Julie That’s why you broke up with me?\n",
      "Chandler You-you-you didn’t know that. (Pause as she nods no.) Well, I guess my work here is done!\n",
      "Joey All right, well first of all I would like to say that you both performed very well. Okay? You should be proud of yourselves. And-and I would also like to say that in this competition there are no losers. Well, except for Rachel—Damnit!\n",
      "Phoebe Really?! I won!\n",
      "Rachel What?!\n",
      "Ross I’m sorry Rach, it was, it was really close.\n",
      "Rachel Well then I demand a recount! (Hmm, I wonder where I’ve heard that before.)\n",
      "Ross Actually, it wasn’t that close.\n",
      "Rachel No! Y’know what? No! No! You thing was so stupid anyway, this was ridiculous—We’re gonna flip a coin! (Phoebe gasps.) All right?! (She flips the coin.) Heads! (Looks at the coin and grunts in disgust.)\n",
      "Phoebe The coins have finally forgiven me!\n",
      "Rachel Well y’know what? I hope Monica forgives you after you throw her, her vegetarian, voodoo, goddess circley shower! (Runs out.)\n",
      "Phoebe (running after her) Rach, it’s gonna be okay! (To Ross and Joey) You guys are the best!\n",
      "Joey Boy I tell ya, that judging stuff took a lot out of me.\n",
      "Ross Yeah?\n",
      "Joey Yeah! I was thinking about maybe going upstairs and taking a little nap on my couch. (Raises his eyebrows, questioning Ross to see if he wants to join him.)\n",
      "Ross Why-why would I care about that?\n",
      "Joey No reason, I’m just saying that uh… That’s where I’ll be.\n",
      "Chandler As bad as that went I actually enjoyed myself. I think that I’m going to apologize for all of the stupid things I do.\n",
      "Monica Why don’t you just stop doing stupid things? Then you wouldn’t have to apologize.\n",
      "Chandler I would really love it if could do both.\n",
      "Monica All right, I…I have to ask.\n",
      "Chandler What?\n",
      "Monica Are you gonna break up with me if I get fat again?\n",
      "Chandler What?!\n",
      "Monica Well, you broke up with Julie Grath! How much weight could she have gained?\n",
      "Chandler A hundred and forty-five pounds.\n",
      "Monica In one year?! My God what did she eat? Her-her family! That’s not the point.\n",
      "Chandler Look I know it was a stupid reason to break up with somebody, but I was 15!\n",
      "Monica Well… That’s not the only time this was an issue. You remember when umm, you spent Thanksgiving with us? You called me fat.\n",
      "Chandler Okay. Okay, now wait a minute that was totally different.\n",
      "Monica How?\n",

      "Monica What if I have babies, okay? I mean I’m gonna look different. I’m okay with that, but I’m not sure that you are!\n",
      "Chandler Look you have to realize I don’t think of you as a thin, beautiful woman. (Monica glares at him.) See this is one of things that I can apologize for later! Look, what I mean is you’re Monica! Okay? And I am in love with Monica.\n",
      "Monica Keep going.\n",
      "Chandler So you can balloon up or you can shrink down and I will still love you.\n",

      "Rachel Yeah. Yeah, and y’know you-you deserve to win. And-and y’know I was thinking about it, if-if you’re Monica’s maid of honor that means I get to be yours.\n",
      "Phoebe Oh yeah!\n",
      "Rachel Yeah! Oh, umm when-when Monica and Chandler got engaged I started putting some stuff together, y’know just in case…\n",
      "Phoebe Oh that’s so sweet thanks.\n",
      "Rachel Here is a book of poetry that I know Monica loves. And-and ohh God this is funny, look, this is a picture of one Halloween where she dressed up as a bride. (Shows Phoebe the picture.) And look, she made me carry her train, which was weird because I was Wonder Woman. Oh and here’s a little purse that I found. (Hands her the purse) Y’know I just thought that maybe they could hold the rings in there.\n",
      "Phoebe Ohh.\n",
      "Rachel And umm, vintage handkerchiefs y’know ‘cause, people cry at weddings. (Starting to cry.) I’m just gonna grab a couple of these.\n",
      "Phoebe This stuff is great!\n",
      "Rachel Oh, I forgot this was in here. Umm, this was the uh garter that I was saving for my wedding and I wanted it to be Monica’s something borrowed and it’s blue. (Starts to cry again.) Yeah…\n",
      "Phoebe Y’know Rach, I think that, I think you should be Monica’s made of honor.\n",
      "Rachel You do? Why?\n",
      "Phoebe Because I think it means more to you.\n",
      "Rachel But Pheebs, y’know you earned it.\n",
      "Phoebe Its fine. I mean, this is something that you’ve been thinking about since you were what, 14? (She’s referring to the Halloween picture.)\n",
      "Rachel No, I was ten. I just developed early.\n",
      "Phoebe (looking at the picture again) Man alive!\n",
      "Monica (entering) Hey, what’s going on?\n",
      "Rachel Hey!\n",
      "Phoebe Well, we just decided that Rachel is gonna be your maid of honor.\n",
      "Monica (gasps) Ohh, wow! That’s great! (Rachel and Monica hug.) Oh wow! We really have to start planning! I have, I have a lot of really specific ideas! We should probably get together like four times per week. You can come over to my place; we’ll get together before work! What do you say, 6:30, my place? I’m so excited! (Runs out leaving Rachel completely stunned and Phoebe laughing.)\n",
      "Rachel Yeah okay, you laugh now, but she’s gonna be yours. (Phoebe gets suddenly scared.)\n"

So he said he wanted to hold off until he was prepared to be really serious.\n",
      "JOEY Wow.\n",
      "PHOE Yeah, so I said, \"OK, relax please,\" y'know, I mean, sex can be just about two people right there in the moment, y'know, it's, if he wants to see me again he can call and if not, that's fine too. So after a looooot of talking. . . I convinced him.\n",
      "JOEY Let me get this straight. He got you to beg to sleep with him, he got you to say he never has to call you again, and he got you thinking this was a great idea.\n",

      "RACH Right, you, you only had a year. We only hung out every night.\n",

      "MRS BUFFAY What are these, stitches?\n",
      "PHOEBE Yeah, eight of them. That's 56 to him. You know also, if, if it's raining, you can't let him look up too long 'cause that cone'll fill up really really fast.\n",

      "Rachel (to Ross) What’s your problem?\n",
      "Ross Nothing, it’s just that hypnosis is beyond crap.\n",
      "Rachel Ross, I watched you get hypnotised in Atlantic City.\n",
      "Ross Hey, that guy did not hypnotise me! Okay.\n",
      "Rachel Oh right, ‘cause you always pull your pants down at the count of three and play Wipe-out on your butt cheeks.\n",

      "Monica What?!\n",
      "Pete Come on, you gotta admit that our relationship is ah, is hitting a new level now. ‘Cause you used to be like the chef, and I was the customer, and now we’re like this-this couple that fights.\n",

      "Frank Uh, no, not really, just that I was too young, y'know, but I don’t see how I could all of the sudden be too young, ‘cause I’m older than I was when we first got together.\n",

      "Chandler Why not?!\n",
      "Joey Oh God. Uh, okay, here’s the thing, this is the thing, okay, the thing is...\n",
      "Chandler What is the thing?\n",
      "Joey Okay. I went down to the ‘Mattress King’ showroom and, and I saw Janice, kissing her ex-husband.\n",
      "Chandler (shocked) What?\n",
      "Joey They were in his office.\n",
      "Chandler Well she, she wouldn’t do that, she’s with, she’s with me.\n",
      "Joey I’m telling you man, I saw it.\n",
      "Chandler Yeah, well, you’re wrong! Okay, you’re wrong.\n",
      "Joey I’m not wrong! I wish I was. I’m sorry. Bet that barium enema doesn’t sound so bad now, huh?\n",
      "Monica It just makes more sense as an ensemble.\n",
      "Rachel Right.\n",
      "Monica Besides, it takes the focus off the hat.\n",
      "Phoebe (running through the door) No! Oh! You’re alive! You’re alive!\n",
      "Rachel See Pheebs, I promised you no one would die, didn’t I?\n",
      "Phoebe Yeah, well, we’ll see about that. Can I use your phone? I just wanna call everyone I know.\n",
      "Monica Sure, we have no money, go ahead.\n",
      "Phoebe (on phone) ‘Hey! You’re not dead! Okay, see ya!’\n",
      "Ben Monica.\n",
      "Monica Oh my God! He just said my name! Did you hear that?\n",
      "Ben Monica bang!\n",
      "Rachel Okay, I heard that.\n",
      "Monica Did he just say ‘Monica bang’?\n",
      "Rachel Uh-huh.\n",
      "Monica Oh my God! He’s gonna rat me out!\n",
      "Ben Monica bang!\n",
      "Monica Oh-ho-ho, sweetie, sweetie, you gotta stop saying that, now. It’s no big deal, it’s not even worth mentioning, you see we all do it all the time. See watch this, Ben, Ben, Ben. (goes over and starts hitting her head on the post) Ow, Monica bang! (does it again) Everybody bang. (repeats) Ben bang. (repeats) Rachel bang. (repeats) Bang, Rachel bang! Oh, isn’t that fun?\n",
      "Rachel (goes over and hits her head on the post) Look at that! (repeats) Look at that! (repeats) We all do it. (repeats) Okay, I’m stopping now.\n",
      "Monica You okay?\n",
      "Rachel Oh yeah! Y'know, if it’s not a headboard, it’s just not worth it.\n",
      "Janice (entering) How’s my Bing-a-ling?\n",
      "Chandler Ah, I don’t know, you tell me. Anything you ah, wanna tell me, because, if you ah, you should, if you, you would, tell me.\n",
      "Janice Why are your eyes so white?\n",
      "Chandler You tell me! Maybe, it’s because I was just fooling with my ex! Oh no-no-no-no, no-no-no-no, that was you!!\n",
      "Janice Oh my God!!\n",
      "Chandler All right!\n",
      "Janice How did you know?\n",
      "Chandler Joey told me, he saw you two kissing.\n",
      "Janice In the park?\n",
      "Chandler No! In his office! How many kisses were there?\n",
      "Janice Just those two!\n",
      "Chandler Wh-wh-why, wh-why, why, why was there kissing!? There should be no kissing!!\n",
      "Janice Oh, I’m sorry honey, I’m so, so, (nasally) haaaaa! I’m so, so sorry, I just (nasally) haaaaaa! But I, oh what happened was, I-I-I can’t breathe. Can you get me a bag, or something?\n",
      "Chandler (giving her a bag) Here.\n",
      "Janice The receipt.\n",
      "Chandler I’ll take it! All right look, I gotta know. Are you finished with me? (Janice shakes her head no) Are you finished with him? (Janice shakes her head no) Do you still love him? (Janice shakes her head yes) Do you still love me? (Janice shakes her head yes) All right look, (grabs the bag) I’m gonna need an actual answer here okay, so which is it, him or me? (his phone starts to ring)\n",
      "Janice I don’t know.\n",
      "Phoebe (rushing in) Okay. If you’re alive you answer your phone!\n",
      "Monica Okay, Ben, I won’t tell your daddy that you had ice cream for dinner, if you don’t tell about our little bonking incident.\n",
      "Rachel Monica, number one, I don’t think Ben understands the concept of bribery, and number two, I... (Joey starts laughing in the background) (to Joey) What?!\n",
      "Joey You said number two.\n",
      "Rachel I also said number one.\n",
      "Joey I know. (giggles harder)\n",
      "Ross (entering) Hey! Everyone.\n",
      "Rachel Hi!\n",
      "Ross How’s my little boy?\n",
      "Rachel He’s perfect, he’s never been better.\n",
      "Ross (noticing the outfit he is wearing) What’d you do, take him whaling?\n",
      "Ben Monica.\n",
      "Ross Oh my God, he just said your name, that’s great! Good job Ben.\n",
      "Ben Monica bang!\n",
      "Monica Oh that’s right, that’s what I’d sound like if I exploded.\n",
      "Phoebe Woo-Hoo! The curse is broken! I called everybody I know, and everyone is alive.\n",
      "Joey Uh.\n",
      "Phoebe What?\n",
      "Joey Ugly Naked Guy looks awfully still. (Phoebe runs to the window and gasps.)\n",
      "Phoebe Oh my God! I killed him! I killed another one! And this curse is getting stronger too, to bring down something that big.\n",
      "Rachel Well maybe he’s just taking a nap.\n",
      "Joey I’m tellin’ ya, he hasn’t moved since this morning.\n",
      "Monica All right, we should call somebody.\n",
      "Ross And tell them what? The naked guy we stare at all the time isn’t moving.\n",
      "Rachel Well, we have gotta find out if he’s alive.\n",
      "Monica How are we gonna do that? There’s no way.\n",
      "Joey Well, there is one way. His window’s open, I say, we poke him.\n",
      "Joey Hey! Y'know how we ah, save all those chopsticks for no reason we get when we get Chinese food?\n",
      "Chandler Yeah.\n",
      "Joey Well, now we got a reason.\n",
      "Chandler What?\n",
      "Joey Well, we’re fashioning a very long poking device.\n",
      "Chandler All right.\n",
      "Joey Hey uh, what’s a matter?\n",
      "Chandler I talked to Janice.\n",
      "Joey Oh my God, is she going back to him?\n",
      "Chandler She doesn’t know. Says she loves us both. Y'know I woke up this morning and I was in love, well I was happy. Y'know it serves me right for buying that twelve pack of condoms. And now I can’t even return them, because she choked on the reciept!\n",
      "Joey What are you ah, what are you gonna do?\n",
      "Chandler I don’t know, y'know. What, what, would you do?\n",
      "Joey Well, it doesn’t matter what I would do.\n",
      "Chandler Come on, tell me.\n",
      "Joey All right, you’re probably not gonna want to hear this but ah, if it was me, and this is just me, (Chandler gets ready to throw another dart) I would ah, I would bow out.\n",
      "Chandler What? (turns around quickly still ready to throw the dart and Joey quickly ducks and hides behind the chair) What are you, what are you talking about?\n",
      "Joey They have a kid together, y'know. They’re like, they’re like a family, and if, I don’t know, there’s chance they could make that work, I know I wouldn’t want to be the guy who stood in the way of that. Are you okay? Do you wanna ah, come poke a nude guy?\n",
      "Ross Well, he’s finally alseep. About that ah, bump on his head?\n",
      "Rachel Are you, are you, are you sure it’s ah, a new bump? I mean, no offense, I’ve always thought of Ben as a fairly bumpy headed child.\n",
      "Ross It’s okay if he bumps his head, kids bump their heads all the time, y'know, it was your first time babysitting, I figured you did the best you could.\n",
      "Rachel (confidently) I did!\n",
      "Ross I know! I’m saying you have to watch them all the time.\n",
      "Rachel I did!! I watched! I watched! I watched Monica bang his head against that thing!\n",
      "Ross Monica did it?\n",
      "Ross Monica?\n",
      "Monica Yeah.\n",
      "Ross Umm, did you notice anything wierd about Ben today?\n",
      "Monica No. Why?\n",
      "Ross Well, I was just playing with him, and y'know we were doing the alphabet song, which he used to be really good at, but suddenly he’s leaving out ‘e’ and ‘f.’ It’s like they just ah, I don’t know, fell out of his head.\n",
      "Monica Really?!\n",
      "Ross Oh, and also, he’s, he’s walkin’ kind of funny, his left leg is moving a lot faster than his right leg, and he’s in there just sort of y'know... (walks around in a circle)\n",
      "Monica Oh my God, I wrecked your baby!! (runs into the bedroom)\n",
      "Rachel I hope it’s still funny when you’re in hell.\n",
      "Monica (coming out of the bedroom) You jerk! You know how much I love that kid! (starts to chase Ross around the living room)\n",
      "Ross Monica bang! Monica bang! (runs into one of the posts) Ow!\n",
      "Rachel I’ll get the hat.\n",
      "Chandler Janice, I have something I need to tell you, and I want you to let me get through it, because it’s, it’s, it’s not gonna be easy.\n",
      "Janice Okay.\n",
      "Chandler I think you should go back with Gary. I don’t wanna be the guy that breaks up a family, y'know when my parents split up, it was because of that guy. Whenever I would see him I was always think y'know ‘You’re the reason, you are the reason why their not together.’ and I hated that guy. And it didn’t matter how nice he was, or how happy he made my Dad.\n",
      "Janice Wow!\n",
      "Chandler Yeah, well. It’s the right thing to do.\n",
      "Janice Oh! You’re right. Oh God. But, before I can say ‘good-bye’, there’s something I really need you to know, Chandler. The way I feel about you, it’s like, I finally understand what Lionel Richie’s been singing about. Y'know, I mean what we have, it’s like movie love, you’re my soulmate, and I can’t believe we’re not going to be spending the rest of our lives together.\n",
      "Chandler Then don’t leave me!\n",
      "Janice What?\n",
      "Chandler Forget what I said, I was babbling! Pick me!\n",
      "Janice No, you were right, you were right. I mean, I-I-I’ve got to give my marriage another chance.\n",
      "Chandler No you don’t! No, no, no, I say you have to give your divorce another chance.\n",
      "Janice (standing up) I’m sorry. (hugs him)\n",
      "Chandler Ohhh. Don’t go.\n",
      "Janice No, I-I-I gotta go. (she starts to walk away, but Chandler doesn’t let her go.)\n",
      "Chandler No. No! No! No!\n",
      "Janice Honey, honey, people are looking.\n",
      "Chandler I don’t care! (turns around and to the people watching them) I don’t care!!\n",
      "Janice Yeah, um, I’m, I’m leaving now. (tries to get her leg out of Chandler’s grasp, she finally does, but Chandler takes off her shoe.)\n",
      "Chandler You can’t leave! I have your shoe!\n",
      "Janice Good-bye Chandler Bing. (walks out with one shoe)\n",
      "Gunther Rachel has those in burgendy.\n",
      "Joey All right now remember, something this big and long is going to be difficult to manuver, fortunately I have a lot of experience in that area.\n",
      "Ross Can we please focus here, a naked man’s life hangs in the balance!\n",
      "Phoebe I’m telling you he’s dead. What we are about to have here is a dead fat guy on a stick.\n",
      "Joey All right, ladies and gentlemen, let’s poke. (they start to advance the giant poking device) Steady. Steady. Okay, a little higher. Careful of the angle. Okay, okay, we’re approaching the window (as he says this the camera cuts to their view of Ugly Naked Guy, so that we actually see him!) Thread the needle. Thread the needle.\n",
      "Phoebe He’s alive! He’s a-live!!!\n",
      "Monica And yet, we’re still poking him.\n",
      "Joey Okay, retract the device, retract the device.\n",
      "Ross He does not look happy.\n",
      "Rachel Hey-hey, now he’s showing us his poking device.\n",
      "Joey Hey, that’s never gonna make it all the way over here, buddy!\n",
      "Chandler (singing) I’ll hold you close in my arms. (Phoebe enters) I can’t resist your charms. And love....\n",
      "Phoebe (joining him) Love....\n",
      "Chandler and Phoebe I’ll be a fool for you. I’m sure, you know I don’t mind.\n",
      "Chandler (high pitched) No you know I don’t mind.\n",
      "Chandler and Phoebe Yes! You mean the world the world to me. Oh...\n",
      "Chandler I know.\n",
      "Phoebe I know.\n",
      "Chandler I’ve found.\n",
      "Phoebe I’ve found....\n",
      "Chandler and Phoebe ...in you, my endless (Phoebe goes high pitched, Chandler goes low pitched) love. (they both look at each other.) My endless love. (once again they don’t match tones, and they just look at each other)\n",

      "Monica (on phone) Okay, great!  Bye. (Hangs up as Chandler enters.) So guess who’s coming to Thanksgiving dinner?\n",
      "Chandler Sydney Portier? Hehheh.\n",
      "Monica (not amused by Chandler’s joke) I miss Rachel. (To Chandler) No, my parents.\n",
      "Chandler Oh! That’s great, they haven’t seen the place since I moved in!\n",
      "Monica Yeah, and y’know, if you could not mention to them that we live together, that would be great! (Quickly trying to change subjects), I was thinking we would eat around four.\n",
      "Chandler (shocked at the news) Why can’t I tell them that we live together?\n",
      "Monica Because they don’t know we’re dating. (Again, trying to quickly change subjects.) Do you think we should eat in the kitchen? (Goes to the sink and the stove to cook.)\n",
      "Chandler Why haven’t you told them?!\n",
      "Monica Um, well, I was going to, I-I-I really was. But um, then somewhere, just out of nowhere, I didn’t.\n",
      "Chandler Why haven’t you told them?! Wouldn’t they be happy?!\n",
      "Monica (trying to change subjects, excitedly) So! Dinner in the kitchen around four! I’ll see you then. (Pats Chandler on the shoulder and goes into the living room.)\n",
      "Chandler Why wouldn’t they be happy?\n",
      "Monica Well, um, because mainly, um, they don’t like you. I’m sorry.\n",
      "Chandler What? What? Why?!\n",
      "Monica Maybe because you used to be aloof, or that you’re really sarcastic, or that, y’know, you joke around all the time. Or that you take off your clothes and throw them on the couch.\n",
      "Chandler Is this why they don’t like me or why you don’t like me?\n",
      "Monica Look, I know that I should’ve told them. I know I shouldn’t care what they think. I’m sorry.\n",
      "Chandler Y’know, it’ll be okay. It’ll be okay. Because when they come over, I will be all charming, I will make them fall in love with me, and then we’ll tell ‘em.\n",
      "Monica You really think that’ll work?\n",
      "Chandler Hey, I can be pretty charming, babe, I won YOU over, didn’t I?\n",
      "Monica (hugging Chandler) I don’t think you’ll ever get my parents that drunk!\n",
      "Chandler Hey! (Sees Ross is there) Oh, good, Ross! You’re parents like me, right?\n",
      "Ross (only half-paying attention) Yes, of course they like you!\n",
      "Chandler Well Monica just told me that they don’t.\n",
      "Ross (not paying attention) Yeah, they don’t like you.\n",
      "Chandler (annoyed) Do you know why?\n",
      "Ross I dunno, maybe it’s because you’re really sarcastic. Or maybe it’s cause you uh-\n",
      "Chandler (angry) Well if people don’t know they shouldn’t just guess!\n",
      "Chandler This is great, another Thanksgiving with nothing to give thanks for.\n",
      "Joey Maybe I could give thanks for you shuttin’ up, eh?\n",
      "Chandler Maybe I could give thanks by taking my Playstation over to my new apartment.\n",
      "Joey Well maybe I love ya’.\n",
      "Chandler [mocks that last comment].\n",
      "Janine [to Chandler] Hey.\n",
      "Chandler Hey.\n",
      "Janine Hey guys!\n",
      "Ross (trying to act manly in front of Janine) No I don’t want to play video games, Joey!\n",
      "Janine Are you guys going to Chandler’s for Thanksgiving?\n",
      "Joey Yeah! Yeah, why? What’s up?\n",
      "Janine Well, me and my dancer friends are thinking of doing Thanksgiving uptown. I thought you guys might like to come.\n",
      "Ross For real?\n",
      "Janine No, but you should go to Chandler’s. Because none of us knows how to cook, we’ll probably just end up drinking all day.\n",
      "Joey Ye-ye, we go to yours!\n",
      "Ross Yeah, see, we-we-we have to stop across the hall, because it’s my sister. But, uh, uh y’know actually, growing up with a sister was nice because it really helped me understand women. Yeah, you-you should tell your friends that.\n",
      "Janine (not sure of what to make of that) Okay.\n",
      "Joey How you got three women to marry you, I’ll never know.\n",

      "All Hey!\n",
      "Rachel Hey! Hey, Pheebs, check it out. Yeah, for my desert, I have chosen to make a traditional English truffle!\n",
      "Phoebe Wow, that sounds great! And what are you making Monica, in case Rachel’s dessert is...[about to say “bad”] so good that I eat all of it. There’s none left for anybody else!\n",
      "Monica Nothing.\n",
      "Rachel (worried) Nothing?\n",
      "Monica No, sweetie, I-I trust you.\n",
      "Rachel So, if-if I mess this up, there’s nothing else for dessert?\n",
      "Monica You’re not gonna mess it up.\n",
      "Rachel Wow, Monica, I love that, you really have faith in me. Thank you. Technical question, how do you know when uh, the butter’s done?\n",
      "Monica Well, it’s done about two minutes before it looks like that.\n",
      "Joey and Ross Hey!\n",
      "All Hey!\n",
      "Joey Oh, ooh the food smells great, Mon!\n",
      "Ross And the place looks so nice!\n",

      "Ross See ya!\n",
      "Monica Whoa whoa whoa! Where’re you goin’?\n",
      "Ross Oh, oh, we did say we’d stop by this little thing Joey’s roommate is having.\n",
      "Monica Oh, Janine, the really hot dancer girl?\n",
      "Ross Some would say she’s attractive, yes.\n",
      "Phoebe And who else is going to be there?\n",
      "Joey Uh, some of her friends, yeah.\n",
      "Rachel Her dancer friends?\n",
      "Joey (frustrated) Yes, all right? All of her hot dancer friends are gonna be there and they’re gonna be, be drinkin’ and dancin, and we really wanna go!\n",
      "Ross (to Joey) Dude, we were good!\n",
      "Monica You’re not gonna go anywhere, you said you were gonna eat here, and you’re gonna eat here!\n",
      "Phoebe Yeah, and-and leaving us to go see hot dancer girls is not very Thanksgivingy.\n",
      "Ross Oh, but-but it is, uh, it’s just like the first Thanksgiving, when the Indians and the Pilgrims uh, sat down to dinner.\n",
      "Joey Yeah, yeah, and the Indians taught the Pilgrims what it meant to be hot in the new world!\n",
      "Mrs. Geller Hello everybody!\n",

      "Mrs. Geller (less than pleased) Oh yes of course, hello Chandler.\n",
      "Chandler Mr. and Mrs. Geller, you look wonderful, it is great to have you hear, let us take off your coats!\n",
      "Chandler Whoa, snowing out there?\n",
      "Mr. Geller (angry) No.\n",
      "Mr. Geller Monica, all this food looks wonderful, you should think about doing this for a living.\n",
      "Mr. Geller Ok, I have dandruff. There’s no need to laugh and point.\n",
      "Monica Dad, Chandler was just laughing at your joke.\n",
      "Mr. Geller My joke wasn’t funny.\n",
      "Phoebe Rach, Rach, I just remembered. I had a dream about Mr. Geller last night.\n",
      "Rachel Really?!\n",
      "Phoebe Yeah, I dreamt that he saved me from a burning building and he was so brave and so strong! And it’s making me look at him totally differently. Y’know, I mean he used to be just, y’know “Jack Geller Monica and Ross’s dad” and now he’s he’s “Jack Geller, dream hunk.\"\n",
      "Rachel I dunno. Y’know to me he’ll always be “Jack Geller, walks in while you’re changing.”\n",
      "Monica Y’know dad, Chandler is one of Ross’s very best friends!\n",
      "Chandler Yeah, Ross sure is a great guy, y’know I’ve always felt that how a young man turns out is a reflection on his father.\n",
      "Mr. Geller I always thought that too. Tell me, what does your father do?\n",
      "Chandler (worried) He’s the headliner of a gay burlesque show.\n",
      "Joey Rach, you’re killin’ us here, will ya serve the dessert already? Those drunken dancers are waiting!\n",
      "Rachel (looking at her truffle) Look at it, isn’t it beautiful?\n",
      "Ross Yeah, yeah, what is it?\n",
      "Rachel It’s a truffle. It’s got all of these layers. First there’s a layer of ladyfingers, then a layer of jam, then custard, which I made from scratch, [Joey and Ross make impressed faces] then raspberries, more ladyfingers, then beef sauteed with peas and onions, [Joey and Ross look like something’s wrong.] then a little more custard, and then bananas, and then I just put some whipped cream on top!\n",
      "Ross W-What was the one right before bananas?\n",
      "Rachel The beef? Yeah, that was weird to me, too. But then, y’know, I thought “well, there’s mincemeat pie,” I mean that’s an English dessert, these people just put very strange things in their food, y’know. [To Joey] Oh! by the way, can I borrow some Rum from your place?\n",
      "Joey Y-sure!\n",
      "Rachel (teasingly) And while I’m gone don’t you boys sneak a taste.\n",
      "Joey and Ross (faking dissapointment) Okay.\n",
      "Ross Beef in a dessert?! I- no no no, there is no way!\n",
      "Joey I know, and only one layer of jam?! What is up with that?\n",
      "Ross Oh my God, the pages are stuck together!\n",
      "Joey (turning to Chandler in a scolding tone) Chandler!\n",
      "Ross Oh My God, she-she made half a English Trifle, and half a...Sheperd’s Pie!\n",
      "Joey (sad) Oh man! Now she’s gonna start all over! We’re never gonna get to introduce the hot girls to the new world!\n",
      "Ross No, no, we will. We just won’t tell her she messed up.\n",
      "Joey Just let her serve the beef-custard thing?\n",
      "Ross Yeah, it’ll be like a funny Thanksgiving story!\n",
      "Joey (shrugging his shoulders to go along with it) Vomiting stories are funny...\n",
      "Rachel Joey, God, your apartment is like a hundred degrees!\n",
      "Joey Did-did it make you wanna walk around in your underwear?\n",
      "Rachel No!\n",
      "Joey (frustrated) Still not hot enough!\n",
      "Phoebe Rachel?\n",

      "Mrs. Geller Oh, thank you Chandler! I just bought it.\n",
      "Chandler Oh, yes. Well it’s very beautiful. It’s cream-colored and tight [Realizes what he just said and looks worried. Monica and Ross also looked shocked. Judy and Jack give Chandler a very dirty look.] I don’t mean tight, I mean it’s not too tight, not that I was looking at-[giving up all hope, he puts his head into his hands.]\n",
      "Mr. Geller What’s the matter with him?\n",
      "Mrs. Geller (whispers to Jack a little loudly) I think he’s stoned again.\n",
      "Chandler (shocked) What?\n",
      "Monica (shocked) What?\n",
      "Ross (worried) Dude, I need to talk to you a sec.\n",
      "Ross Okay, I think I might know why my parents don’t like you.\n",
      "Chandler You do? Why?\n",
      "Ross Okay, remember, we were young. Hey, Spring break, sophomore year, I got high in my bedroom and my parents walked in and smelled it and so I told them that you had gotten stoned and jumped out the window.\n",
      "Chandler What?! Why did you do that?\n",
      "Ross I don’t know, aheh, your’s was the first name that-that popped into my head, I’m I’m sorry. I-I didn’t think it would matter.\n",
      "Chandler How could it not matter?!\n",
      "Ross How was I supposed to know we’d end up being friends after college, let alone you-you would be living with my sister?\n",
      "Chandler What about all that “friends forever” stuff?\n",
      "Ross I don’t know, I-I was all high.\n",
      "Monica Mom and dad just sent me in here to find out if you (points to Chandler) were trying to get Ross stoned!\n",
      "Chandler Your parents caught Ross smoking pot in college and he blamed it on me!\n",
      "Monica Ross, I can’t believe you’d do that!\n",
      "Chandler The reason we haven’t told them we’re together is because they hate me, okay? So will you fix this?\n",
      "Ross Okay, okay, I’ll tell ‘em it wasn’t Chandler who got high. Now who should I say it was?\n",
      "Monica You! It’s not like it’s a big deal! You-you don’t still do it or anything!\n",
      "Ross Alright, alright, now-now who should I say tricked me into doing it?\n",
      "Monica Dad, please don’t pick your teeth out here! Alright, and if you’re gonna put your feet up, why don’t you sit on the-\n",
      "Phoebe Monica, leave him alone!\n",
      "Joey (to Rachel) Will you hurry up? Did you not hear me before when I told you that all of Janine’s friends are dancers?! And that they’re going to be drinking alot!?\n",
      "Rachel (sarcastically) No, I did, but tell me again, because it’s so romantic.\n",
      "Joey Well you’re whippin’ so slow! Can’t you do it any faster?\n",
      "Rachel Joey! Come on! I don’t wanna make any mistakes, alright? This is the only dessert and if I screw it up everybody's gonna be like “Oh, remember that Thanksgiving when Rachel screwed up the trifle?”\n",
      "Rachel So why don’t you just let me worry about making the trifle and you just worry about eating it, alright?\n",
      "Joey Oh I am!\n",
      "Monica Ross, if you don’t tell them, then I will!\n",
      "Ross Okay, fine!\n",
      "Joey Ross! Can I talk to you for a second?\n",
      "Ross Oh, uh, can it wait a second Joey? I have to tell my parents something. No it can’t? Okay.\n",
      "Joey Okay, look, I think we have to tell Rachel she messed up her dessert.\n",
      "Ross What?! What is with everybody? It’s Thanksgiving, not...Truth-Day!\n",
      "Joey Look, when everyone eats that...that...Banana-Meat thing, they’re all gonna’ make fun of her, do you want that?\n",
      "Ross Okay, okay, we’ll just get everyone to act like they like it. That-that way noone makes fun of her and we still get to go to Sweet Potatoe Pie! (Referring to the dancers.)\n",
      "Joey (scolding) Dude, they’re not objects.\n",
      "Joey Just kiddin,’ I’ll talk to them, you distract Rach.\n",
      "Ross Hey Rach, can I talk to you outside for a second?\n",
      "Rachel Okay...\n",
      "Rachel What’s up, Ross?\n",
      "Ross So um...Thanksgiving. The holiday season is upon us, hm?\n",
      "Rachel Yeah!\n",
      "Ross And um...You look nice today.\n",
      "Rachel Oh no. No Ross, don’t do this.\n",
      "Ross What?\n",
      "Rachel I just- I don’t think us getting back together is a good idea.\n",
      "Ross (shocked) Eh?\n",
      "Rachel I thought this might happen today. Ross, I know the holidays can be rough. Y’know? And it’s probably really hard for you to be alone right now.\n",
      "Ross (cutting her off) You’re alone.\n",
      "Rachel No, I-I live with Phoebe. I mean you’re [pity-tone] alone, alone. And I just-it’s just not the time for us. I’m sorry.\n",
      "Ross (just trying to get out of the conversation) Ah well, can’t blame a guy for trying!\n",
      "Joey Oh and (Ross begins to open the door and Joey says some gibberish word to indicate to Ross that he’s not done yet. Ross closes the door again.) Okay, and uh if anyone needs help pretending to like it, I learned something in acting class, try uh, rubbing your stomach (Rubs his stomach) or uh, or saying “mmm” and uh, oh oh! And smiling (Smiles while pretending to stir a bowl), okay?\n",
      "Chandler Yeah, I’m not gonna pay for those acting classes anymore.\n",
      "Joey Rachel, there you are! Come on, let’s serve that dessert already!\n",
      "Rachel Joey, you’re gonna have to stop rushing me, you know what? You don’t get any dessert.\n",
      "Joey (happily) Really?\n",
      "Rachel No, I’m just kidding I would never do that to you! Okay, everybody, it’s trifle time!\n",
      "Phoebe So, now, Rach, this is a traditional English trifle, isn’t it?\n",
      "Rachel It sure is.\n",
      "Phoebe Wow. So then did you make it with beef or Eggplant?\n",
      "Rachel Beef.\n",
      "Phoebe I can’t have any. You know I don’t eat meat. (Faking dissapointment.) Ohhh no.\n",
      "Rachel Alright, Monica, I want you to have the first taste.\n",
      "Monica Really?\n",
      "Rachel Oh oh oh, wait! You only got whipped cream in there! Ya gotta take a bite with all the layers!\n",
      "Monica Okay.\n",
      "Rachel Op! Wait, you dropped a pea.\n",
      "Rachel Well?\n",
      "Monica (faking joy. Rubbing her stomach and smiling at the same time, like Joey said) Mmmm! It’s good!\n",
      "Rachel Really? How good?\n",
      "Monica It’s so good, that I feel really selfish about being the only one who’s eating it, that I think we should have everyone taste how good it is. Especially Ross.\n",
      "All (faking enjoyment) Mmm.\n",
      "Chandler (clearly lying and hating the dessert) Yeah, this is so good, that I’m gonna go enjoy it on the balcony so that I can enjoy the view whilst I enjoy my dessert.\n",
      "Mrs. Geller (lying) I’ve gotta call my friend Mary and tell her how good this is, from Monica’s room.\n",
      "Mr. Geller (also lying) I’ll help you dial.\n",
      "Monica (again, lying) I’m gonna go into the bathroom so I can look at it in the mirror, as I eat it.\n",
      "Rachel Okay, now what was that all about? Is it-does it not taste good? Let me try it.\n",
      "Ross Wha? No no! Ah! (Ross scarfs all of his trifle down in about a second. He looks like he’s going to throw up.) (Lying) All gone! So good! Maybe Chandler has some left.\n",
      "Ross It tastes like feet!\n",
      "Joey I like it.\n",
      "Ross Are you kidding?\n",
      "Joey What’s not to like? Custard? Good. Jam? Good. Meat? Gooooood.\n",
      "Rachel ...So a bird just grabbed it, and then tried to fly away with it and, and then just dropped it on the street?\n",
      "Chandler (lying) Yes, but if it’s any consolation, before the bird dropped it, he seemed to enjoy it.\n",
      "Phoebe Rachel, come here. (Rachel walks over to Phoebe. Chandler sits down on the lounge-chair.) Okay, I was just starting to take my Thanksgiving nap, and I had another dream about Jack.\n",
      "Rachel Oh, Phoebe, do I wanna hear this?\n",
      "Phoebe I dunno, let’s see! So, okay, I dreamt that we were gonna get married, and he left, becuz he had to go fight a fire. And, um, so okay, I went to a night club, and I saw him making out with a girl.\n",
      "Rachel (humoring Phoebe) Oh my God, he dream-cheated on you!\n",
      "Phoebe Yeah, but then Jacques Cousteau came and he kicked his ass for betraying me! It was soo cool! Then, he took me diving and he introduced me to his pet seahorse, who, by the way, was totally coming on to me, and please, that is not gonna happen.\n",
      "Mr. Geller Boy, I’m glad I wore the big belt today.\n",
      "Phoebe Five minutes ago, a line like that would’ve floored me. Now nothing. Well, not nothing, I am still a woman.\n",
      "Monica Ross? Let’s go.\n",
      "Ross Oh yeah, about telling Mom and Dad, I was thinking about maybe writing a letter.\n",
      "Monica Alright, you know what? That’s it. You’ve had your chance.\n",
      "Ross Wha-what?\n",
      "Monica (out loud, to her parents) Mom! Dad! Ross smoked pot in college!\n",
      "Mr. and Mrs. Geller What?!\n",
      "Ross (in a 5 year old’s tone) (To Monica) You are such a tattletale! Mom, Dad, you remember that-that time you walked in my room and smelled marijuana?\n",
      "Mr. and Mrs. Geller Yes. (They look at Chandler angrily.)\n",
      "Ross Well I told you it was Chandler who was smoking the pot but it was me. I’m sorry.\n",
      "Mrs. Geller It was you?\n",
      "Monica And Dad, y’know that mailman that you got fired? He didn’t steal your Playboys! Ross did!\n",
      "Ross Yeah, well, Hurricane Gloria didn’t break the porch swing, Monica did!\n",
      "Monica Ross hasn’t worked at the museum for a year!\n",
      "Ross Monica and Chandler are living together!\n",
      "Monica Ross married Rachel in Vegas! And got divorced! Again!!!!\n",
      "Phoebe (joining in) I love Jacques Cousteau!\n",
      "Rachel (reading the recipe magazine, finally figuring out that...) I wasn’t supposed to put beef in the trifle!\n",
      "Joey (pounding the table) I wanna gooooooo!\n",
      "Mrs. Geller (rubbing her temples) That’s alot of information to get in in thirty seconds! Alright Joey, if wanna leave, just leave. Rachel, no you weren’t supposed to put beef in the trifle. It did not taste good. Phoebe, I’m sorry, but I think Jacques Cousteau is dead. (Phoebe makes a sad face.) Monica, why you felt you had to hide the fact that you were in an important relationship is beyond me.\n",
      "Mr. Geller And we kinda figured about the porch swing.\n",
      "Mrs. Geller Ross, drugs? Divorced? Again?\n",
      "Mr. Geller What happened son?\n",
      "Ross I-I uh, I got tricked into all those things!\n",
      "Mrs. Geller Chandler! You’ve been Ross’s best friend all these years, stuck by him during the drug problems. (Ross gets disgusted.) And now you’ve taken on Monica as well. Well, I don’t know what to say. You’re a wonderful human being.\n",
      "Chandler Thank you!\n",
      "Mr. Geller No! Thank you! (Hugs Chandler) Monica, and Ross! I don’t know what I’m gonna do about the two of you!\n",
      "Chandler (In a parent-like tone) I’ll talk to them!\n",
      "Rachel You guys! It was bananas, cream, and beef! I-I just cannot believe that you ate that so that I wouldn’t feel bad!\n",
      "Monica Well actually, I-I didn’t eat mine. It’s still in the bathroom.\n",
      "Joey No it isn’t, I ate that.\n",
      "Mrs. Geller (pointing to herself and Jack) Well we left ours in Monica’s bedroom.\n",
      "Joey Nope, got it and I got yours (Pointing to Jack) too.\n",

      "Chandler Yeah, I mean when you were late last night, Kathy and I got to talking, and one thing to another and…\n",
      "Joey And what?! Did you sleep with her?!\n",
      "Chandler No! No! No! I just kissed her.\n",
      "Joey What?!! That’s even worse!!\n",
      "Chandler How is that worse?!\n",
      "Joey I don’t know! But it’s the same!\n",
      "Chandler You’re right, I have no excuses! I was totally over the line.\n",
      "Joey Over the line?! You-you’re-you’re so far past the line, that you-you can’t even see the line! The line is a dot to you!\n",
      "Chandler Look, I’m not saying that you should magically forgive me! But you’re not perfect! You’ve made some errors in judgment too!\n",
      "Joey Name one!\n",
      "Chandler (lets him out) What happened?!!\n",

      "Chandler Do you think he’ll ever forgive me?\n",
      "Rachel Of course he will! But Chandler the most important thing is you forgive yourself!\n",
      "Chandler Y’know what? I-I kinda have.\n",
      "Rachel Already? That’s pretty bad what you did.\n",
      "Monica Y’know what? He will forgive you. And I like to bring a pad with me when I go answer the phone just in case… (Chandler gets that disgusted look back.) Okay…\n",
      "Chandler You didn’t see how mad he was, y’know?\n",
      "Rachel I’m sure he will forgive you. Look, we have all been there! Y’know, you fight, you make up, it’s just the way it works.\n",
      "Ross It took two people to break up this relationship!!\n",
      "Rachel Yeah! You and that girl from that copy place, which yesterday you took full responsibility for!!\n",

      "Rachel Y'know I can’t believe I even thought about getting back together again! We are so over!!\n",
      "Ross (starts to cry) FINE BY ME!! (he opens the door and traps Chandler behind it)\n",
      "Rachel And hey! Just so you know, it’s not that common! It doesn’t happen to every guy! And it is a big deal!!\n",
      "Chandler (coming out from behind the door) I KNEW IT!!!!\n",
      "Monica You had no right to go out with him.\n",

      "Chandler Oh my God!\n",
      "Joey Look at me! I'm Chandler! Could I be wearing any more clothes? Maybe if I wasn't going commando...\n",
      "Joey Yeah. Whew, it's hot with all of this stuff on. I ah, I better not do any, I don't know, lunges. (starts doing lunges)\n",
      "Chandler Joey? Got you a Joey Special, two pizzas! Joe? (The phone rings and he answers it) (On phone) Hello? (Takes the phone away from his mouth when he realizes what he just did and yells.) Damnit! (Back on phone.) Hello? (Listens.) No, Joey’s not here right now, but I can take a message I think. (Listens) He’s still got a chance for the part?! Oh, that’s great news! (Listens) Well no obviously not for the actor who was mauled by his dog. (Listens) Oh well, that’s great. I will give Joey the message. Thank you! (Hangs up and goes to write the message on the Magna-Doodle.) Yes! (Reading what he’s writing) Okay, Mac audition at 2:00. Allergy actor attacked. (Pause) By dog not flowers.\n",
      "Joey Hey!\n",
      "Chandler Please tell me you got the message!\n",
      "Joey What message?\n",
      "Chandler The actor playing Mac couldn’t do it, they needed to see you at 2 o’clock.\n",
      "Joey What?! It’s 6 o’clock!\n",
      "Chandler Du-du-I wrote it, I wrote it on the board! I wrote it on the board, then I went all over New York City looking for ya! I went to Ross’s! I went to the coffeehouse! I went to any place that they made sandwiches!\n",
      "Joey I can’t believe this Chandler!\n",
      "Chandler Sorry! I-I-I don’t know what to say.\n",
      "Joey Well you-you-you-you might say congratulations! I saw the board! I went to the audition! I got the part!!\n",
      "Chandler (angrily) Is that supposed to be funny! I was really worried over here!\n",
      "Joey Oh, well I’m uh…\n",
      "Chandler Y’know, sometimes that fake out thing is just mean!\n",
      "Joey Oh wow! Okay man, I’m sorry. I did not mean to make you feel bad.\n",
      "Chandler Well that’s good. Because you didn’t! And I’m incredibly happy for ya!!\n",
      "Joey (shocked) That’s mean! You really had me going there!\n",
      "Chandler Oh, we could do this all day.\n",
      "Joey Yeah, you’re right. Okay look, listen, let’s talk about what a huge star I’m gonna be!\n",
      "Chandler You are gonna be a huge star! I’m gonna hug ya!\n",
      "Joey You hug me!\n",
      "Chandler All right!\n",
      "Joey Hey, do we do this too much?\n",
      "Chandler I think so. Yeah, get off me.\n",
      "Joey Yeah.\n",
      "Joey Come on C.H.E.E.S.E., I’m not leaving without you! Try routing your backup source through your primary CPU.\n",
      "Phoebe (overacting badly) I can’t! My circuits are fried! They’re fried I tell you!!\n",
      "Joey Wow! (Back to reading the scene.) Well then I’ll just have to carry you.\n",
      "Ross That’ll be a neat trick, when you’re, (looks at the script) when you’re dead!\n",
      "Joey Ross, you don’t have to yell.\n",
      "Ross There was just an explosion, okay? My hearing would be impaired.\n",
      "Phoebe I thought you were excellent! In fact for a minute there I was like, \"Ooh, where’d Ross go?\"\n",
      "Ross Thank you! And I have to say that first scene when you meet Mac…\n",
      "Phoebe Yeah?\n",
      "Ross Oh my God. I mean…\n",
      "Joey Y’know what? I think that’s enough for today. Thanks for your help! (He grabs their scripts and heads for his room.)\n",

      "Joey (holding a box) Well, remember when they got in that big fight and broke up and we were all stuck in her with no food or anything? Well, when Ross said Rachel at the wedding, I figured it was gonna happen again, so I hid this in here.\n",

      "Chandler (watching TV, in fact, ER is on.) Nothing! It's over! Dammit! This is regularly scheduled programming!\n",
      "Monica Can we turn the TV off? Okay? Do we really want to spend the entire weekend like this?\n",
      "Chandler Oh, I'm sorry, am I getting in the way of all the room switching fun?\n",
      "Monica Hey, don't blame me for wigging tonight!\n",
      "Chandler Oh, who should I blame? The nice bell man who had to drag out luggage to 10 different rooms?\n",
      "Monica I don't know, how about the idiot who thought he could drive from Albany to Canada on a half a tank of gas!\n",

      "Ross Okay, y'know how you told me I should do whatever it takes to fix my marriage?\n",
      "Rachel Yeah, I told you to give Emily whatever she wants.\n",
      "Ross And while that was good advice, you should know that what-what she wants…\n",
      "Rachel Yeah?\n",
      "Ross …is for me not to see you anymore.\n",
      "Rachel That's crazy! You can't do that! What are you going to tell her? (Pause) (Realizes) Oh God. Ohh, you already agreed to this, haven't you?\n",
      "Ross It's awful I know, I mean, I feel terrible but I have to do this if I want my marriage to work. And I do, I have to make this marriage work. I have too. But the good thing is we can still see each other until she gets here.\n",
      "Rachel Ohh! Lucky me! Oh my God! That is good news, Ross! I think that's the best news I've heard since Le Poo died!\n",
      "Ross You have no idea what a nightmare this has been. This is so hard.\n",
      "Rachel Oh yeah, really? Is it Ross? Yeah? Okay, well let me make this a just a little bit easier for you.\n",
      "Ross What are you doing?\n",
      "Rachel Storming out!\n",
      "Ross Rachel, this is your apartment.\n",

      "Joey How was your conference?\n",
      "Chandler It was terrible. I fought with (Pause) my colleagues y'know, the entire time. Are you kidding with this? (Throws away another Rollo)\n",
      "Joey Oh, so your weekend was a total bust?\n",
      "Chandler Uh, no, I got to see Donald Trump waiting for an elevator.\n",
      "Monica (entering) Hi!\n",
      "Joey Hey, you're back too!\n",
      "Monica Yeah. Umm, Chandler can I talk to you outside for a second?\n",
      "Joey Hey, how was your chef thing?\n",
      "Monica Oh, it was awful. (To Chandler) I guess some people just don't appreciate really good food.\n",
      "Chandler Well, maybe it was the kind of food that tasted good at first but then made everybody vomit and have diarrhea.\n",
      "Monica Chandler! (Motions for him to come outside.)\n",
      "Chandler Monica. (Follows her out.)\n",
      "Monica Okay, I'd like to know how much the room was because I'd like to pay my half.\n",
      "Chandler Okay, fine, $300.\n",
      "Monica 300 dollars?!\n",
      "Chandler Yeah, just think of it as $25 per room!\n",
      "Monica Urghh!!\n",
      "Joey (sticking his head out the door) What are you guys woofing about?\n",
      "Monica Chandler stole a twenty from my purse!\n",
      "Joey Nooooo!!! Y'know what? Now that I think about it, I constantly find myself without twenties and you always have lots!\n",
      "Ross You should've seen the look on her face. I don't want Rachel to hate me! I don't know what to do.\n",
      "Joey You want my advice?\n",
      "Ross Yes! Please!\n",
      "Joey You're not gonna like it.\n",

      "Joey I-I-I don't know if this falls under this category, but uh, Ross is right back there. (Points over his shoulder.)\n",
      "Rachel That's not Ross!\n",
      "Phoebe Oh no! Not that guy! He does look like him though.\n",
      "Chandler Okay, Ross is in the bathroom.\n",
      "Rachel Oh my God, its happening. It's already started. I'm Kip.\n",
      "Joey Hey, you're not Kip!\n",
      "Rachel (To Joey) Do you even know who Kip is?\n",
      "Joey Who cares? You're Rachel! (To Chandler) Who's Kip?\n",
      "Chandler Kip, my old roommate, y'know we all used to hang out together.\n",
      "Joey Oh, that poor bastard.\n",
      "Rachel See? Yeah, you told me the story. He and Monica dated when they broke up they couldn't even be in the same room together and you all promised that you would stay his friend and what happened? He got phased out!\n",
      "Monica You're not gonna be phased out!\n",
      "Rachel Well, of course I am! It's not gonna happen to Ross! He's your brother. (To Chandler) He's your old college roommate. Ugh, it was just a matter of time before someone had to leave the group. I just always assumed Phoebe would be the one to go.\n",

      "Joey Hey, Mr. Bing. That uh, hotel you stayed at called. Said someone left an eyelash curler in your room.\n",
      "Chandler Yes that was mine.\n",
      "Joey 'Cause I figured you'd hooked up with some girl and she'd left it there.\n",
      "Chandler Yes that would have made more sense.\n",
      "Joey Y'know, I-I don't even feel like I know you anymore man! All right, look, I'm just gonna ask you this one time. And whatever you say, I'll believe ya. (Pause.) Were you, or were you not on a gay cruise?!\n",
      "Rachel Phoebe? (She turns her head further away.) I'm sorry about the whole lifting out thing. (Moves over next to her.) You gotta come with me!\n",
      "Phoebe Come where?\n",
      "Rachel Wherever I go. Come on you and me, we'll-we'll start a new group, we're the best ones.\n",

      "Ross Hi.\n",
      "Rachel Hi. What are you doing here? Isn't this against the rules?\n",
      "Ross I talked to Monica, look, I'm the one who made the choice. I'm the one who's making things change, so I should be the one to y'know, step back.\n",
      "Rachel Oh, Ross…\n",
      "Ross No, no, it's okay. Really. They're plenty of people who just see their sisters at Thanksgiving and just see their college roommates at reunions and just see Joey at Burger King. So is, is that better?\n",
      "Rachel No, it's not better. I still don't get to see you.\n",
      "Ross Well, what-what would you do? Rach, if you were me, what-what would you do?\n",
      "Rachel Well, for starters I would've said the right name at my wedding!\n",

      "Chandler So, I guess this is over.\n",
      "Monica What?\n",
      "Chandler Well, y'know, you and me, it had to end sometime.\n",
      "Monica Why, exactly?\n",
      "Chandler Because of the weekend, we had a fight.\n",
      "Monica Chandler that's crazy! If you give up every time you'd have a fight with someone you'd never be with anyone longer than—Ohhh! (They both realize something there.)\n",
      "Chandler So, this isn't over?\n",
      "Monica (laughs) You are so cute! No. No, it was a fight. You deal with it and move on! It's nothing to freak out about.\n",
      "Chandler Really? Okay. Great!\n",
      "Monica Ohh, welcome to an adult relationship! (She goes to kiss him.)\n",
      "Chandler (stops her) We're in a relationship?\n",

      "Monica Hey, Rach, can I borrow your eyelash curler, I think I lost mine.\n",
      "Rachel Yeah, it's in there. (Points to the bathroom.)\n",
      "Joey (shocked) Oh! Ohh! Oh!!\n",
      "Chandler Joey, can I talk to you for a second? (He grabs him and starts to drag Joey into Monica's room.)\n",
      "Joey Oohh!! Ohh! Oh-oh-oh! Oh-oh!!\n",
      "Joey Ohhhhhhhhhhh!!!!!!!\n",
      "Chandler Yes. Yes. (Lets him up.)\n",
      "Joey (To Chandler) You?! (To Monica) And-and you?!\n",
      "Monica Yes, but you cannot tell anyone! No one knows!\n",
      "Joey How?! When?!\n",
      "Chandler It happened in London.\n",
      "Joey IN LONDON!!!\n",
      "Chandler The reason we didn't tell anyone was because we didn't want to make a big deal out of it.\n",
      "Joey But it is a big deal!! I have to tell someone!\n",
      "Chandler No-no-no-no-no! You can't!\n",
      "Monica Please? Please?! We just don't want to deal with telling everyone, okay? Just promise you won't tell.\n",
      "Joey All right! Man, this is unbelievable! I mean, it's great, but…\n",
      "Monica I know, it's great!\n",
      "Joey Aww, I don't want to see that!\n",
      "Phoebe We're so stupid! Do you know what's going on in there? They're trying to take Joey!\n",
      "Phoebe The most popular Phoebe in tennis is called the overhand Phoebe. And if you win, you must slap your opponent on the Phoebe and say, \"Hi, Phoebe!\"\n",
      "Monica Oh that's cute! We really all enjoyed it. But y'know, it doesn't count.\n",
      "Phoebe Count for what?\n",
      "Monica Count in our heads as-as good Madlibs.\n",
      "Joey I guess I'm done.\n",
      "Chandler Fun's over!\n",
      "Monica Wait-wait, guys! If-if we follow the rules, it's still fun and it means something!\n",
      "Rachel Uh-huh!\n",
      "Joey I think I'm gonna take-off.\n",
      "Monica Guys, rules are good! Rules help control the fun! (They all leave and close the door on Monica.) Ohhh! (Throws her notepad down in disgust.)\n",

      "Chandler (To Monica) Wow! Listen, we had a good run. What was it? Four? Five months? I mean, that's more than most people have in a lifetime! So, good-bye, take care, bye-bye then! (He kisses her and starts to climb out the balcony window.)\n",

      "Ross (happily) My best friend and my sister! I cannot believe this. (He hugs them both.) (To Joey and Rachel) You guys probably wanna get some hugs in too, huh? Big news!\n",
      "Rachel Awww, no, it's okay, we've actually known for a while.\n",

      "Phoebe Yeah. I really like his glasses.\n",
      "Ross …so then President Steve told everyone that I was a cheapskate, and now the whole building hates me! A little kid spit on my knee! Y'know what I'm gonna do? I'm gonna throw a party. That's right. For everyone in the building, and I'm gonna sit them down and explain to them, I am not a bad guy. I am not a cheap guy! I'm just a guy who-who stands up for what he believes in. A man with principles.\n",
      "Chandler (To Rachel) Sounds like a fun party.\n",
      "Rachel Hmm. Look, Ross, if you want your neighbors to like you, why don't you just pay the hundred bucks? The party's gonna cost you way more than that.\n",
      "Ross It doesn't matter! It's my principles! We're talking about my principles!\n",
      "Rachel Okay, I thought it was about your neighbors liking you.\n",
      "Ross Oh, they'll like me. Once they come to my awesome PAR-TAY! Okay, I gotta run. I gotta go get some nametags. (Exits.)\n",
      "Rachel And that crazy party animal will be your brother-in-law.\n",
      "Chandler Very, very funny, but don't say things like that in front of Monica. I don't want you putting any ideas in her head.\n",
      "Rachel Umm, Chandler, you do realize that those ideas are probably already in Monica's head.\n",
      "Chandler Wh-wh-why?!\n",
      "Rachel Well, because she loves you and because you love her.\n",
      "Chandler Yeah, so, what's that supposed to mean?!\n",
      "Rachel Hey, Chandler, don't freak out! I'm telling you something you already know! Come on, she broke up with Richard because he didn't want to have babies. And she's a woman, and she's almost 30, and y'know it's Monica.\n",
      "Chandler I don't see it that way. Okay? Because, I see two Monicas, the one that was my friend, who lived across the hall, and wanted to have a lot of babies and then the new Monica, who I just started to date. Now, who's to say what she wants?! I’m right. I'm right. Am I right?\n",
      "Rachel No, you're right, you are absolutely right. I mean that makes, that makes everything different.\n",
      "Chandler Okay. It's not different at all, is it?\n",
      "Rachel Not unless different means the same.\n",
      "Katie You were so funny with that waiter! You're such a nut! (She slaps her thighs, Joey jerks, and spills some of his coffee.)\n",
      "Joey (sets the coffee down) Y'know, breadstick fangs are always funny.\n",
      "Katie No, you make them funny. You're the funny one! (She punches him again and he retreats to the arm of the couch.)\n",
      "Joey Uhh, look Katie, uh listen, we-we need to talk. Okay? Umm, look I like you. I-I really do, I like you a lot. Okay? But sometimes when you, when you playfully punch me like that it-it feels like someone's hitting me with a very tiny but very real bat.\n",
      "Katie Aww, like I could hurt you. Are you making fun of my size? Don't make fun of me because of my size! (She punches him again and almost knocks him off the arm of the couch.)\n",
      "Monica Isn't this great?\n",
      "Chandler Hmm.\n",
      "Monica Couldn't you just stay like this forever? (His eyes snap open.) Chandler! Couldn't you just stay here forever?\n",
      "Chandler Yeah, here, somewhere else, y'know where-where ever. (Gets up.)\n",
      "Monica Are you okay?\n",
      "Chandler Yeah, I'm cool. Casual.\n",
      "Monica What-what are you doing?\n",
      "Chandler I'm just hanging out. Y'know, having fun. Y'know with the girl that I'm seeing casually.\n",
      "Monica Man, I knew it! I knew you were going to do this!!\n",
      "Chandler What?!\n",
      "Monica Get all freaked out because everybody was talking and just joking around about marriage and stuff.\n",
      "Chandler Well, you do want all that stuff, right?\n",
      "Monica Oh and you know what I want!\n",
      "Chandler Yes! You want babies! You have baby fever!\n",
      "Monica I do not have baby fever!\n",
      "Chandler Oh please, you are obsessed with babies and-and marriage and everything that's related to babies and-and marriage! I've got an idea, why don't we turn down the heat on this pressure cooker?!\n",
      "Monica Have you lost your mind? Chandler, this isn't about me! This is about you and all your weird relationship commitment crap!\n",
      "Chandler Nah-uh! I know you! Okay? I know the thoughts that you have in the head--in your head!\n",
      "Monica You don't know everything. Did you know that I'm going out with Rachel tonight instead of you? Hmm? And did you know that the only baby around here is you?! And did you know that I can't even look at you right now?! (She storms out.)\n",
      "Chandler Well, I did not know that.\n",
      "Chandler It's gonna be okay, right? I mean she's not gonna leave me? This is, this is fixable.\n",
      "Ross and Joey Oh yeah, yeah, sure. Absolutely.\n",
      "Chandler By me?\n",
      "Ross Oh, no!\n",
      "Joey No-no.\n",
      "Ross Well, unless you make some kind of big gesture.\n",
      "Joey Yeah, big!\n",
      "Joey Uh-oh, shht! The Misses.\n",
      "Monica Gunther, can I get a coffee (Looks at Chandler) to go?\n",
      "Chandler Monica. (Goes to talk to her.)\n",

      "Chandler Just tell me what I need to do to make things right.\n",
      "Monica What?!\n",
      "Chandler Well, that's what we do. Y'know, I-I mess up and then you tell me how to fix it and then I do and then y'know you think I'm all cute again.\n",
      "Monica Really? I'm really tired of being your relationship tutor. You're gonna have to figure this one for yourself. All right? Y'know what? If you're too afraid to be in a real relationship, then don't be in one. (She walks out.)\n",
      "Party Guests (chanting) Howard! Howard! Howard! Howard! (Ross goes to investigate the noise) Howard! Howard! Howard! (They're holding Howard above their heads.) Howard! Howard! Howard! Howard!

      "Ross You chipped in?!\n",
      "Phoebe Yeah, uh-huh, a 100 dollars.\n",
      "Ross Phoebe! I can't believe you gave them money! I thought you agreed it was totally unreasonable that they asked me for that money!\n",
      "Phoebe Yeah, but they didn't ask me! Y'know? This way I'm just y'know, the exotic, generous stranger. That's always fun to be.\n",
      "Ross Yeah, but you're making me look bad!\n",
      "Phoebe No I'm not. No! If anything I'm making you look better! They'll see you talking to me and that's--I'm a hit!\n",

      "Phoebe Hey!\n",

      "Rachel Uhhh, yeah. But it's not obvious why.\n",
      "Joey Well look, I’m breaking up with Katie so I had to put on some extra padding. Y'know? I mean, if she hits me when she's happy, can you imagine how hard she's gonna hit me when I tell her I'm taking away the Joey love?\n",

And okay, you guys (She turns to an elderly gentleman and a 20 something woman, who're a couple.) (To the girl) Gold-digger, (To the old guy) cradle robbing perv! So, I think you all know what I mean.\n",
      "Phoebe Obviously I didn't think they were gonna start throwing things. I just thought if I kept insulting everyone, you would jump in and defend everyone and then you could look like the hero.\n",
      "Ross Oh wow, yeah! See, I did not get that.\n",
      "Chandler Where's Monica?! Where is she? I need to talk to her! It's urgent! Is she here?\n",
      "Monica (raising her hand) I'm Monica.\n",
      "Chandler I need to talk to you, it's urgent!\n",
      "Monica Okay.\n",
      "Chandler Okay, I've been doing a lot of thinking about us, y'know a lot of uhh, us thinking. And uh, well I guess there's only one-one way to do this. (He slowly and awkwardly gets down on one knee.)\n",
      "Monica Wait what-wh-wh-what are you doing?!\n",
      "Chandler (getting out a ring box) Monica…\n",
      "Monica No-no, don't-don't-don't do it!\n",
      "Chandler Will you marry me?\n",
      "Ross Oh-no. No. No.\n",
      "Joey What a bad idea!\n",
      "Rachel Ohhhh, I cannot look at it! (She doesn't move.)\n",
      "Monica Chandler, why are you doing this?\n",
      "Chandler I don't know. But I know I'm not afraid to do this.\n",
      "Monica Chandler.\n",
      "Chandler I'm doing this because I'm sorry?\n",
      "Monica Do you umm, you really think the best reason to get married is because you're sorry?\n",
      "Chandler No, the best reason to get married is pregnancy. Sorry is pretty much fourth y'know, behind being ready and actually wanting to get married. (Laughs.) Will you be my wife?\n",
      "Monica (kneels with him) Chandler, umm, I want you to take just a minute and I want you to think about how ridiculous this sounds.\n",
      "Chandler Yeah, I'm kinda wishing everyone wasn't here right now.\n",
      "Monica Honey! Do you know that none of that stuff came from me?! I mean I never said I wanted to have babies and get married right now!\n",
      "Chandler Yeah I know, but I was really confused and then I talked to these guys. (Turns to look at Ross and Joey.)\n",
      "Monica Who? Two divorces and Joey?!\n",
      "Ross Hey!\n",
      "Joey She's right y'know.\n",
      "Ross Yeah, but still, cheap shot!\n",
      "Monica Y'know what? Y'know when I said that I want you to deal with this relationship stuff all on your own? Well, you're not ready for that.\n",
      "Chandler I didn't think I was!\n",
      "Monica Oh my God, what would have done if I said yes?\n",
      "Chandler Well I would've been happy because I would've be able to spend the rest of my life with the woman that I love. Or, you would've seen a Chandler shaped hole in that door. (Points at the door.)\n",
      "Joey Hey Ross, will you pass me that knife?\n",
      "Ross No, I will not!\n",
      "Joey Oh, it's okay. You don't have to be so mean about it.\n",
      "Ross You're right, I'm sorry. Will you marry me?\n",
      "Phoebe Aw, and I was gonna ask you to marry me because I forgot to say hello to you last week.\n",
      "Rachel Oh no wait Pheebs, I think for something like that you just ask them to move in with you. But I'm not sure, Chandler?\n",
      "Chandler Okay, how long is this going to go on.\n",
      "Monica Well I think the length of teasing is directly related to how insane you were so, a long time.\n",
      "Ross This is fun. Hey Rach, remember that whole \"We were on a break thing?\" Well, I'm sorry, will you marry me? (Laughs--whines as he sees that no one is laughing. They're just staring at him in shock.)\n",
      "Chandler That's not funny.\n",
      "Joey That's not funny at all!\n",

      "Gunther Oh umm, uh we don’t sell cigarettes, but they have them at the newsstand across the street. (Points.)\n",

      "Rachel Oh, wow thanks! (Reading the card) Oh you’re in real estate!\n",
      "Melissa Oh no, that’s-that’s an old card. Umm, I wanted to get out of that and-and do something where I can really help people and-and make a difference.\n",

      "Rachel No we weren’t! It was nothing! It was one night, senior year we went to a party, had a lot of sangria and y’know, ended up…kissing for a bit.\n",
      "Ross So that’s two of my wives.\n",
      "Monica (telling Chandler the seating arrangement) Okay so this is where the band is. (Points.) And this is where the bar is. (Points) And all these pins have people’s names on them. (She has pins to show the seating at each of the tables.) And Rach, here you are. (Points to Rachel’s place.)\n",
      "Rachel Oh wow. Why don’t we just take me (Grabs her pin) and put me with a Manhattan in my hand, talking to the cute bartender. (Puts her pin at the bar and laughs. Monica just glares at her.) These pins aren’t for playing are they?\n",
      "Monica (To Chandler) Okay, the red ones are my guests and the blue ones are yours.\n",

      "Rachel I’m Monica’s maid of honor. Okay? Don’t try to blue pin me!\n",
      "Chandler (sees another rack) Well, what’s the deal with these? These-these look nice.\n",
      "Rachel Oh they are nice. We-we custom-make tuxedos for celebrities and then when they’re done with them they just send ‘em back.\n",
      "Chandler You mean like for award shows?\n",
      "Rachel Some of them.\n",
      "Chandler You mean these tuxes have been down the red carpet with people yelling, \"You are you wearing?! You look fabulous!\"\n",
      "Rachel Honey, might I suggest watching a little more ESPN and a little less E!?\n",
      "Chandler Okay, who wore those? (Points to the tuxedos.)\n",
      "Rachel Umm, well let’s see uh, this one is Tom Brokaw.\n",
      "Chandler Not bad.\n",
      "Rachel (reading a tag) This one is uh Paul O’Neil.\n",
      "Chandler Who’s that?\n",
      "Rachel He plays for the Yankees. Seriously, ESPN! Just once and a while, have it on in the background. (Chandler nods and Rachel grabs another tux) Ooh, this one was Pierce Brosnan!\n",
      "Chandler Pierce Brosnan?\n",
      "Rachel Uh-huh.\n",

      "Rachel It’s a pretty cool tux.\n",
      "Chandler Oh, it’s not just that, I would be England’s most powerful weapon. Jet setting heartbreaker on her majesty’s secret service. A man who fears no one; with a license to kill. (Worried.) Would Monica let me wear this?\n",
      "Joey We should really learn how to play the real way. (Moves another piece.)\n",
      "Phoebe I like our way. Oh! (Grabs a piece and jumps a bunch of Joey’s like in Checkers.) Chess!\n",
      "Joey Nice move.\n",

      "Joey No, I’m performing the ceremony. I’m not wearing a tux.\n",
      "Rachel Well, what are you going to wear?\n",
      "Joey Multi-colored robes! Ooh, and maybe a hat.\n",
      "Rachel Huh. Does Monica know about this?\n",
      "Joey I don’t think so.\n",
      "Rachel Can I please be there when you tell her? (Joey nods yes.)\n",

      "Rachel Oh, y’know what? I can’t. I have to have dinner with that Melissa girl.\n",
      "Joey (excitedly) Can I come?! I won’t even talk! You’ll just hear the noise from my video camera.\n",
      "Phoebe What is this? What’s going on?\n",
      "Joey Oh good! Can I tell her?! Can I tell her?!\n",
      "Rachel Well, do you want to hear what actually happened or Joey’s lewd version?\n",
      "Phoebe Joey’s!\n",
      "Joey Okay…\n",
      "Rachel Hey, come on! I had this friend from college and I made the stupid mistake of telling Joey that one time…she and I y’know…kissed a little bit.\n",
      "Phoebe (laughs) Yeah, I’m sure that happened.\n",
      "Rachel It-it did!\n",
      "Phoebe Sure!\n",
      "Joey Hey. (Laughs then seriously) It happened!\n",
      "Rachel Yeah, it was senior year in college. It was after the Sigma Chi luau and Melissa and I got very drunk! And we ended up kissing! For several minutes!\n",
      "Phoebe (To Joey) Which means she had a couple spritzers and a quick peck on the cheek.\n",
      "Joey Why are you taking this away from me?\n",
      "Rachel Yeah, why is it so hard for you to believe?!\n",
      "Phoebe Okay! I just—I didn’t know that you are a lesbian. (Joey smiles and nods lewdly.)\n",
      "Rachel I’m not saying that I’m a lesbian! I’m just saying that this happened!\n",
      "Phoebe Okay, it just seems pretty wild and you’re so—y’know so…vanilla.\n",
      "Rachel (shocked) Vanilla?!\n",
      "Phoebe Yeah.\n",
      "Rachel I’m not vanilla! I’ve done lots of crazy things! I mean I got-I got drunk and married in Vegas!\n",
      "Phoebe To Ross.\n",
      "Rachel All right, y’know what? If you don’t want to believe me about this, why don’t you just come with me to dinner tonight and she will tell you.\n",
      "Phoebe Okay! All right! Yeah! ‘Cause I just can’t picture it.\n",
      "Joey Oh-ho, you should get inside my head.\n",
      "Ross Hey! Guess what I got for your wedding! (Holding up his garment bag.)\n",
      "Chandler A freakish thin date with a hanger for her head?\n",
      "Ross No. Rachel hooked me up with a tux! But not just any tux, Batman’s tux!\n",
      "Chandler What?\n",
      "Ross That’s right! Made expressly for Val Kilmer and worn by him in the hit film…that Batman film he was in.\n",
      "Chandler You can’t wear that! I’m wearing the famous tux! James Bond’s tux!\n",
      "Ross So?\n",
      "Chandler So—If you wear that you’ll make mine less special.\n",
      "Ross Well, you need something to make this day special? Hello! You-you-you have the most special thing of all! You are marrying the woman you love.\n",
      "Chandler Please, don’t take away my cool thing. Please?! Pretty please?!\n",
      "Ross Pretty please? Not very uh, 007.\n",
      "Chandler Look, it’s my wedding day okay? If you were getting married I would never do anything to upset you.\n",
      "Ross When I got married you slept with my sister.\n",
      "Chandler That was pretty 007.\n",
      "Joey Hey.\n",
      "Monica Hey. Oh good-good you’re here! All right, I figured it out. I’m gonna take two tables of eight, I’m gonna add your parents, and I’m gonna turn them into three tables of six. Okay? And I called the caterer; I added two extra meals, we are good to go!\n",
      "Joey Yeah, they’re not coming.\n",
      "Monica (looking at him) What?!\n",
      "Joey Somehow they got the idea that you only invited them because of me. They…feel a little unwanted.\n",
      "Monica Oh that’s too bad. It’s true, but too bad.\n",
      "Joey Look Mon, if you could just call my mom…\n",
      "Monica Oh Joey!\n",
      "Joey Come on! Look just-just tell—let her know that you really want them to be there. Let’s not forget, this is a woman that has sent you many lasagnas over the years.\n",
      "Monica No she hasn’t.\n",
      "Joey Is it her fault that some of them didn’t make it to you?\n",
      "Monica Well, what am I going to say?\n",
      "Joey I don’t know. Just uh, just tell ‘em it was a mix-up with the invitations, or—No-no-no! Blame it on the post office. They hate the post office. And the Irish! But I don’t think you can blame it on them so… (He dials the phone and hands it to Monica.)\n",
      "Monica (on phone) Hello? (Listens) Yeah, hi! Mrs. Tribbiani? (Listens) Hi, this is Monica Geller. (Listens) Yeah I’m just calling to say that Chandler and I uh, really hope you can make it to the wedding. Yeah, apparently a bunch of invitations that we sent weren’t delivered. Umm, I guess there was some screw up at the damn post office! (Joey nods his approval.) (Listens) T-Tell me about it! (Listens) Yeah, yeah, the US Post Office? No, more like US lost office! (Listens) What are they Irish?! (Joey gives her a thumbs up.)\n",
      "Melissa …anyway, his name is Allan and we’ve been going out for three years. He was my first client when I became a party planner. He was planning a party for his girlfriend at the time. Oh well. (Rachel and Phoebe politely laugh) And he was Theta Beta Pi at Syracuse.\n",
      "Rachel Oh. Oh, that’s great!\n",
      "Melissa Hmm Phoebe, were you ever in a sorority?\n",
      "Phoebe Of course! Yeah, I was uh, umm Thigh Mega Tampon.\n",
      "Melissa What one?\n",
      "Phoebe Yeah! Y’know, we were really huge too, but then they had to shut us down when Regina Philange died of alcohol poisoning.\n",
      "Melissa Oh, isn’t a shame when one girl ruins it for the whole bunch? (Phoebe agrees by grunting.)\n",
      "Rachel (changing the subject) Anyway, speaking of drinking too much. I was uh, tellin’ Phoebe about that one crazy night after the Sigma Chi luau where you and I uh, we made out.\n",
      "Melissa (shocked) What?\n",
      "Rachel Remember?! We—come on both had the sarongs on, and we had the-the coconut bikini tops…\n",
      "Melissa Yeah?\n",
      "Rachel …we went back the house and we got really silly and we…we made out.\n",
      "Melissa Oh wow, Ray-ray I have no idea what you’re talking about.\n",
      "Phoebe Really?!\n",
      "Chandler Ross is Batman!\n",
      "Monica Well, he did manage to keep his identity secret for a long time.\n",
      "Chandler Rachel got Ross the tuxedo that Val Kilmer wore in Batman. Okay Batman is so much cooler than James Bond!\n",
      "Monica What are you talking about?! 007 has all those gadgets!\n",
      "Chandler Batman has a utility belt!\n",
      "Monica 007 has a fancy car!\n",
      "Chandler Batman has the Batmobile!\n",
      "Monica 007 gets all the ladies.\n",
      "Chandler Batman has Robin! (Pause) We get ESPN right?\n",
      "Monica How about you go put on your 007 tuxedo and I’ll make you a nice martini.\n",
      "Chandler Actually, I don’t like martinis.\n",
      "Monica How about a Youhoo with a funny straw?\n",
      "Chandler Ooh, yum! (Runs into the bedroom.)\n",
      "Joey (entering) Hey.\n",
      "Monica Hey.\n",
      "Joey Listen, I know the invitation says 6:00, but does that mean that you want people to get there at six, or the show is gonna start right at six?\n",
      "Monica The show?!\n",
      "Joey Right. Right. The wedding, gotcha. But I mean, it’s gonna start a little late right? I mean, weddings start late. Right?\n",
      "Monica Have you ever been to one of my weddings?\n",
      "Joey Ah. Yeah. Well look, the thing is it’s the same day as my niece’s christening and I really want my parents to be there in time to see me. ‘Cause my part’s just in the beginning I’m not even in the rest of the show—Wedding!\n",
      "Monica The wedding starts at six.\n",
      "Joey Okay. Okay, I totally hear ya. Oo how about this? I vamp a little ‘til they get there?\n",
      "Monica You’ll vamp?!\n",
      "Joey Yeah! Yeah y’know, like warm up the crowd. Ask ‘em where they’re from. ‘Cause in Joey Tribbiani you get a minister and you get an entertainer. I’m a minis-tainer! (Rapping) There is no one better! There is no one greater!\n",
      "Rachel How can you not remember us kissing?!\n",
      "Melissa I don’t know. I don’t remember a lot of things that never happened.\n",
      "Rachel Wh… Come on! Remember? We were on the sleeping porch! We couldn’t stop giggling? And our coconuts kept knockin’ together?\n",
      "Phoebe Oh, somewhere Joey’s head is exploding.\n",
      "Rachel Yeah—but come on—Listen, I’m sorry I don’t want to make you uncomfortable, but I told Phoebe that it happened and she doesn’t believe me.\n",
      "Melissa I’m sorry Ray-ray. I mean if I thought it happened I would say it. Maybe I passed out and you did stuff to me while I was sleeping.\n",
      "Rachel No!!\n",
      "Phoebe Rachel, it’s okay. You don’t have to do this. I believe you. All right? Okay, if-if you say that you kissed Melissa, then you kissed Melissa.\n",
      "Rachel Thank you Phoebe.\n",
      "Melissa She didn’t.\n",
      "Phoebe I know.\n",
      "Ross Hey!\n",
      "Monica You just carry that around?\n",
      "Ross Yes. I find it to be something of a conversation piece.\n",
      "Monica Between you and…\n",
      "Ross Gunther. (To Chandler) Hey-hey! Why don’t we put them on? Y’know get a picture of Batman and James Bond together.\n",
      "Chandler I would but mine doesn’t fit. The pants are a little tight.\n",
      "Monica A little tight? I could see double-oh and seven in those pants.\n",
      "Ross Well that stinks. I was looking forward to us wearing our celebrity tuxes together.\n",
      "Chandler Well, does that mean that you’re not going to wearing yours?\n",
      "Ross What are you kidding? It’s Batman’s tux!!\n",
      "Chandler (standing up) Let me try it on!\n",
      "Ross Okay, but just the jacket. Double-oh and seven are not gettin’ in there.\n",
      "Chandler (trying on the jacket) Okay. Holy double-vented comfort Batman! (Finds something in the pocket) What’s this?\n",
      "Ross What?\n",
      "Chandler An invitation for the At First Sight premiere? Oh my God! Val Kilmer didn’t wear this in Batman! He wore it to the premiere of some tooty-fruity love story where he played a blind guy!\n",
      "Ross Let me see that! (Grabs the invitation and reads it.) Oh man!\n",
      "Chandler The only superpower you have is a slightly heightened sense of smell. (Hands him the jacket and walks away.)\n",
      "Joey (entering) Hey! Uh, Monica? Chandler? Can I talk to you guys for a second?\n",
      "Monica All right that’s it, I give up! Whatever you want you can have it! You wanna sing a song? You wanna do a dance? You want your mom stand at the Alter and scream racial slurs? I don’t care!\n",
      "Joey No! No, I-I just wanna thank you guys for what you did for my parents, that was really sweet. They’re so happy they get to be a part of your special day.\n",

      "Chandler Well, you’re welcome. And tell them we’re really glad they’re coming.\n",
      "Joey Okay. I will. Ohh! Check out what they got me to wear for the ceremony! (Runs to his apartment and returns wearing a rather silly hat.) Huh? I wear it like this when I marry you guys, and then this (He tilts it to the side of his head) is for party time.\n",
      "Rachel It happened! I am telling you it happened!\n",
      "Melissa Okay. (To Phoebe) Well, it was great meeting you. And uh Rachel, I-I don’t think I’ll be calling you (hails a cab) because umm, y’know you’ve gotten weird. (The cab pulls up.) Take care you guys.\n",
      "Rachel What?! Wait a minute! No wait a minute! (She does so.) Okay? Look, that night was the one wild thing I have ever done in my entire life, and I’m not gonna let you take that away from me! Okay, so if you don’t remember that, maybe you will remember this! (She grabs Melissa and kisses her on the lips.)\n",
      "Melissa My God! You love me!\n",
      "Rachel (shocked) What?\n",
      "Melissa Of course I remember our kiss. I think about it all the time. I can still hear the coconuts knockin’ together I… (Phoebe is shocked.) I just didn’t want to tell you ‘cause I didn’t think that you’d return my love, and now that you have… (Leans in to kiss Rachel.)\n",
      "Rachel (moving away) Whoa! Whoa-whoa-whoa-whoa! Whoa! Whoa!\n",
      "Melissa Aww, look who’s being suddenly shy. You can’t tell me you don’t feel what I feel. Nobody can kiss that good and not mean it. (Goes in again.)\n",
      "Rachel (moves away again) I-I-I-I’m just…I’m just a good kisser!\n",
      "Melissa (suddenly frightened) Shut up!\n",
      "Rachel I’m sorry!\n",
      "Melissa (laughs) Oh you don’t have to be (Laughs again) sorry. I’m…I’m obviously kidding. I’m not in love with you. (To Phoebe) I’m not in love with her. I don’t hear coconuts banging together. Yeah, I don’t…picture your face when I make love to my boyfriend. Anyway, I gotta go. Eh…kiss good-bye? (Rachel stares at her stunned.) No? Okay. (Hurries into the cab and drives off.)\n",
      "Rachel Wow! I mean I had no idea that that was gonna…\n",
      "Rachel What the hell was that?!\n",
      "Phoebe I just wanted to see what all the fuss was about.\n",

      "Phoebe I’ve had better.\n",
      "Chandler (yelling from the changing room) All right! I found one that fits!\n",
      "Rachel Well y’know what they say, the 23rd time’s the charm. (Chandler enters.) Aww, look at you all handsome!\n",
      "Chandler Whose is it?\n",
      "Rachel Oh does it matter?! All that matters is that you look so handsome.\n",
      "Chandler Whose is it?\n",
      "Rachel I don’t want to say.\n",
      "Chandler Oh, come on! I don’t care! Come on! Whose is it?\n",
      "Rachel Diane Keeton.\n",

One, my friends are the most important thing in my life, two, I never lie, and three, I make the best oatmeal raisin cookies in the world. (Phoebe opens a tin and offers Rachel a cookie)\n",
      "Rachel (taking cookie) Ok, thanks Pheebs (takes bite of cookie, overwhelmed) Oh my God, why have I never tasted these before?!\n",

      "Phoebe The end.\n",
      "Rachel Oh, God...\n",
      "Phoebe Should I not have told you?\n",
      "Rachel No, no, trust, me, it's, it's, it's much better that I know. Uh, I just liked it better before it was better...\n",
      "Phoebe I think she took it pretty well. You know Paolo's over there right now, so...\n",
      "Monica We should get over there and see if she's okay. (switching places with Ross) Just one...second! Score! (Monica scores, high-fives with Ross) Game! Come on. (Monica and Phoebe leave)\n",
      "Ross (wiping his brow) Ah...ooh! Well, looks like, uh, we kicked your butts.\n",
      "Joey No-no, she kicked our butts. You could be on the Olympic standing-there team.\n",
      "Ross Come on, two on one.\n",
      "Chandler What are you still doing here? She just broke up with the guy, it's time for you to swoop in!\n",
      "Ross What, now?\n",
      "Joey Yes, now is when you swoop! You gotta make sure that when Paolo walks out of there, the first guy Rachel sees is you, She's gotta know that you're everything he's not! You're like, like the anti-Paolo!\n",
      "Chandler My Catholic friend is right. She's distraught. You're there for her. You pick up the pieces, and then you usher in the age of Ross! (Ross and Chandler look off into the distance. Joey, wondering what they are looking at, looks in the same direction)\n",
      "Paolo No, that's cold, that's cold, that's...\n",
      "Ross (entering) How's it going?\n",
      "Monica Don't stare. Now she just finished throwing his clothes off the balcony, now there's just a lot of gesturing and arm-waving, (shows Rachel gesturing with hands in front of her chest), Ok, that is either, \"How could you?\" or, \"Enormous breasts!\" Here he comes!\n",
      "Phoebe Ooh!\n",
      "Paolo Uh, I am, uh, to say good-bye.\n",
      "Phoebe Oh, ok bye-bye.\n",
      "Monica Paolo, I really hate you for what you did to Rachel, (hands him a lasagna) but I still have five of these, so heat it at 375 until the cheese bubbles.\n",
      "Paolo Grazie.\n",
      "Ross Paolo, I-I just want to tell you and I think I speak for everyone when I say... (shuts door in his face and walks away)\n",
      "Phoebe Oh, just look at her... (girls move toward Rachel on the balcony)\n",
      "Ross Oh you guys, I-I really think just one of us should go out there so she's not overwhelmed...\n",
      "Monica Oh, you're right.\n",
      "Ross (pulls Monica back) ...and I really think it should be me.\n",
      "Ross Hey.\n",
      "Rachel Hey.\n",
      "Ross You all right?\n",
      "Rachel Ooh, I've been better...\n",
      "Ross Come here. (he hugs Rachel) Listen, you deserve so much better than him...you know, I mean, you, you, you should be with a guy who knows what he has when he has you.\n",
      "Rachel Oh, Ross...\n",
      "Ross What?\n",
      "Rachel I am so sick of guys. I don't want to look at another guy, I don't want to think about another guy, I don't even want to be near another guy. (Ross crosses arms)\n",
      "Ross Huh.\n",
      "Rachel Oh Ross, you're so great!\n",
      "Ross Ohhhh (Hugs her and sighs)\n",
      "Monica Ooh...hey honey, are you all right?\n",
      "Rachel Oh...\n",
      "Phoebe You ok?\n",
      "Rachel ...medium...hmm...any cookies left?\n",
      "Phoebe Yep!\n",
      "Ross See, Rach, uh, see, I don't think that swearing off guys altogether is the answer. I really don't. I think that what you need is to develop a more sophisticated screening process.\n",
      "Rachel No. I just need to be by myself for a while, you know? I just got to figure out what I want\n",
      "Ross Uh, no, no, see, because not...not all guys are going to be a Paolo.\n",
      "Rachel No, I know, I know, and I'm sure your little boy is not going to grow up to be one.\n",
      "Ross (astonished) What?\n",
      "Rachel What?\n",
      "Ross I-I'm, I'm having a boy?\n",
      "Rachel Uh...no. No, no, in fact, you're not having a boy.\n",
      "Ross Wha-I'm having, I'm having a boy! (babbling) Huh, am I having a boy?\n",
      "Girls Yes, you're having a boy! (Monica runs over and hugs Ross)\n",

      "Chandler Yeah, get out!\n",
      "Monica You guys are always hanging out in my apartment! Come on, I'll only use my left hand, huh? Come on, wussies! (Joey and Chandler pick her up) All right, ok, I gotta go. I'm going, (they throw her out) and I'm gone.\n",

      "Monica Absolutely.\n",
      "Chandler Yeah, I think for us, kissing is pretty much like an opening act, y'know? I mean it's like the stand-up comedian you have to sit through before Pink Floyd comes out.\n",
      "Ross Yeah, and-and it's not that we don't like the comedian, it's that-that... that's not why we bought the ticket.\n",
      "Chandler The problem is, though, after the concert's over, no matter how great the show was, you girls are always looking for the comedian again, y'know? I mean, we're in the car, we're fighting traffic... basically just trying to stay awake.\n",
      "Rachel Yeah, well, word of advice: Bring back the comedian. Otherwise next time you're gonna find yourself sitting at home, listening to that album alone.\n",
      "Joey (pause)....Are we still talking about sex?\n",
      "Ross No, it's good, it is good, it's just that- mm- doesn't she seem a little angry?\n",
      "Marsha Well, she has issues.\n",
      "Ross Does she.\n",
      "Marsha He's out banging other women over the head with a club, while she sits at home trying to get the mastodon smell out of the carpet!\n",
      "Ross Marsha, these are cave people. Okay? They have issues like 'Gee, that glacier's getting kinda close.' See?\n",
      "Marsha Speaking of issues, isn't that your ex-wife?\n",
      "Ross (trying to ignore her) No. No.\n",
      "Marsha Yes, it is. Carol! Hi!\n",
      "Ross Okay, okay, yes, it is. (waves) How about I'll, uh, catch up with you in the Ice Age.\n",
      "Ross Hi.\n",
      "Carol So.\n",
      "Ross You look great. I, uh... I hate that.\n",
      "Carol Sorry. You look good too.\n",
      "Ross Ah, well, in here, anyone who... stands erect... So what's new? Still, uh...\n",
      "Carol A lesbian?\n",
      "Ross Well... you never know. How's, um.. how's the family?\n",
      "Carol Marty's still totally paranoid. Oh, and, uh-\n",
      "Ross Why- why are you here, Carol?\n",
      "Carol I'm pregnant.\n",
      "Ross Pregnant?!\n",
      "Chandler Oh, I think this is the episode of Three's Company where there's some kind of misunderstanding.\n",
      "Phoebe ...Then I've already seen this one! (Turns off the TV.)\n",
      "Monica (taking a drink from Joey) Are you through with that?\n",
      "Joey Yeah, sorry, the swallowing slowed me down.\n",
      "Monica Whose little ball of paper is this?!\n",
      "Chandler Oh, uh, that would be mine. See, I wrote a note to myself, and then I realised I didn't need it, so I balled it up and... (sees that Monica is glaring at him) ...now I wish I was dead.\n",
      "Phoebe She's already fluffed that pillow... Monica, you know, you've already fluffed that- (Monica glares at her.) -but, it's fine!\n",
      "Monica Look , I'm sorry, guys, I just don't wanna give them any more ammunition than they already have.\n",
      "Chandler Yes, and we all know how cruel a parent can be about the flatness of a child's pillow.\n",
      "Phoebe Monica- Hi! Um, Monica, you're scaring me. I mean, you're like, you're like all chaotic and twirly. And not-not in a good way.\n",
      "Joey Yeah, calm down. You don't see Ross getting all chaotic and twirly every time they come.\n",
      "Monica That's because as far as my parents are concerned, Ross can do no wrong. Y'see, he's the Prince. Apparently they had some big ceremony before I was born.\n",
      "Chandler (looking out the window) Ew, ew, ew, ew ew ew ew ew!\n",
      "Monica What?\n",
      "Chandler Ugly Naked Guy got a Thighmaster!\n",
      "All Eeaagh!\n",
      "Rachel Has anybody seen my engagement ring?\n",
      "Phoebe Yeah, it's beautiful.\n",
      "Rachel Oh God, oh God, oh God oh God oh God oh God.... (Starts to look under the couch cushions.)\n",
      "Phoebe No, look, don't touch that!\n",
      "Rachel Oh, like I wasn't dreading tomorrow enough, having to give it back to him... 'Hi Barry! Remember me? I'm the girl in the veil who stomped on your heart in front of your entire family!' Oh God and now I'm gonna have to return the ring, without the ring, which makes it so much harder...\n",
      "Monica Easy Rach, we'll find it. (To all) Won't we!\n",
      "Chandler and Joey Oh! Yeah!\n",
      "Joey Alright, when'd'ya have it on last?\n",
      "Phoebe Doy! Probably right before she lost it!\n",
      "Chandler You don't get a lot of 'doy' these days...\n",
      "Rachel I know I had it this morning, and I know I had it when I was in the kitchen with...\n",
      "Chandler ...Dinah?\n",
      "Rachel (looks at the lasagne and realizes something) Ohhhhh, don't be mad...\n",
      "Monica You didn't.\n",
      "Rachel Oh, I am sorry...\n",
      "Monica I gave you one job! (Starts to examin the lasagne through the bottom of the glass pan.)\n",
      "Rachel Oh, but look how straight those noodles are!\n",
      "Chandler Now, Monica, you know that's not how you look for an engagement ring in a lasagne...\n",
      "Monica (puts down the lasagne) I just... can't do it.\n",
      "Chandler Boys? We're going in.\n",
      "Ross (standing outside the door).....Hi.\n",
      "Monica Wow. That is not a happy hi.\n",
      "Ross Carol's pregnant.\n",
      "Phoebe (while everyone else is stunned) Ooh! I found it!\n",
      "Monica W-w-wh-... wha-... w-w-w-...\n",
      "Ross Yeah. Do that for another two hours, you might be where I am right about now. (He enters.)\n",
      "Chandler Kinda puts that whole pillow thing in perspective, huh, Mon?\n",
      "Rachel Well now, how-how do you fit into this whole thing?\n",
      "Ross Well, Carol says she and Susan want me to be involved, but if I'm not comfortable with it, I don't have to be involved.. basically it's entirely up to me.\n",
      "Phoebe She is so great! I miss her.\n",
      "Monica What does she mean by 'involved'?\n",
      "Chandler I mean presumably, the biggest part of your job is done.\n",
      "Ross Anyway, they want me to go down to this- sonogram thing with them tomorrow.\n",
      "Rachel So what are you gonna do?\n",
      "Ross I have no idea. No matter what I do, though, I'm still gonna be a father.\n",
      "Joey .....Well, this is still ruined, right?\n",
      "Mrs. Geller Oh, Martha Ludwin's daughter is gonna call you. (Tastes a snack) Mmm! What's that curry taste?\n",
      "Monica Curry.\n",
      "Mrs. Geller Mmmm!\n",
      "Ross I- I think they're great! I, I really do.\n",
      "Mr. Geller (To Ross) Do you remember the Ludwins? The big one had a thing for you, didn't she?\n",
      "Mrs. Geller They all had a thing for him.\n",
      "Ross Aw, Mom...\n",
      "Monica I'm sorry, why is this girl going to call me?\n",
      "Mrs. Geller Oh, she just graduated, and she wants to be something in cooking, or food, or.... I don't know. Anyway, I told her you had a restaurant-\n",
      "Monica No Mom, I don't have a restaurant, I work in a restaurant.\n",
      "Mrs. Geller Well, they don't have to know that... (She starts to fluff the same pillow Monica fluffed multiple times earlier.)\n",
      "Monica Ross, could you come and help me with the spaghetti, please?\n",
      "Ross Yeah. (They go to the kitchen.)\n",
      "Mrs. Geller Oh, we're having spaghetti! That's.... easy.\n",
      "Monica I know this is going to sound unbelievably selfish, but, were you planning on bringing up the whole baby/lesbian thing? Because I think it might take some of the heat off me.\n",
      "Mrs. Geller What that Rachel did to her life.... We ran into her parents at the club, they were not playing very well.\n",
      "Mr. Geller I'm not gonna tell you what they spent on that wedding... but forty thousand dollars is a lot of money!\n",
      "Mrs. Geller Well, at least she had the chance to leave a man at the altar...\n",
      "Monica What's that supposed to mean?\n",
      "Mrs. Geller Nothing! It's an expression.\n",
      "Monica No it's not.\n",
      "Mr. Geller Don't listen to your mother. You're independent, and you always have been! Even when you were a kid... and you were chubby, and you had no friends, you were just fine! And you would read alone in your room, and your puzzles...\n",
      "Mr. Geller Look, there are people like Ross who need to shoot for the stars, with his museum, and his papers getting published. Other people are satisfied with staying where they are- I'm telling you, these are the people who never get cancer.\n",
      "Mr. Geller ...And I read about these women trying to have it all, and I thank God 'Our Little Harmonica' doesn't seem to have that problem.\n",
      "Monica (trying desperately to change the subject) So, Ross, what's going on with you? Any stories? (Digs her elbow into his hand.) No news, no little anecdotes to share with the folks?\n",
      "Ross (pulls his hand away) Okay! Okay. (To his parents) Look, I, uh- I realise you guys have been wondering what exactly happened between Carol and me, and, so, well, here's the deal. Carol's a lesbian. She's living with a woman named Susan. She's pregnant with my child, and she and Susan are going to raise the baby.\n",
      "Mrs. Geller (To Monica) And you knew about this?!\n",
      "Joey Your folks are really that bad, huh?\n",
      "Ross Well, y'know, these people are pros. They know what they're doing, they take their time, they get the job done.\n",
      "Monica Boy, I know they say you can't change your parents,... boy, if you could- (To Ross) -I'd want yours.\n",
      "Ross Must pee. (Goes to pee.)\n",
      "Phoebe Y'know, it's even worse when you're twins.\n",
      "Rachel You're twins?\n",
      "Phoebe Yeah. We don't speak. She's like this high-powered, driven career type.\n",
      "Chandler What does she do?\n",
      "Phoebe She's a waitress.\n",
      "Rachel All right, you guys, I kinda gotta clean up now. (They all start to leave.)\n",
      "Monica Chandler, you're an only child, right? You don't have any of this.\n",
      "Chandler Well, no, although I did have an imaginary friend, who... my parents actually preferred.\n",
      "Rachel The lights, please..\n",
      "Ross ...How long was I in there?\n",
      "Rachel I'm just cleaning up.\n",
      "Ross D'ya.. uh.. d'ya need any help?\n",
      "Rachel Uh.. okay, sure! Thanks! (She hands him the broom and sits down.)\n",
      "Ross Anyway.. um.. (Starts to sweep.) So, you- uh- you nervous about Barry tomorrow?\n",
      "Rachel Oh.. a little..\n",
      "Ross Mm-hmm..\n",
      "Rachel A lot.\n",
      "Ross Mm.\n",
      "Rachel So, got any advice? Y'know, as someone who's recently been- dumped?\n",
      "Ross Well, you may wanna steer clear of the word 'dumped'. Chances are he's gonna be this, this broken shell of a man, y'know, so you should try not to look too terrific, I know it'll be hard. Or, y'know, uh, hey!, I'll go down there, and I'll give Barry back his ring, and you can go with Carol and Susan to the OB/GYN...\n",
      "Rachel Oh, you've got Carol tomorrow.. When did it get so complicated?\n",
      "Ross Got me.\n",
      "Rachel Remember when we were in high school together?\n",
      "Ross Yeah.\n",
      "Rachel I mean, didn't you think you were just gonna meet somone, fall in love- and that'd be it? (Ross gazes at her.) ..Ross?\n",
      "Ross Yes, yes!\n",
      "Rachel Oh! Man, I never thought I'd be here.. (She leans back onto his hand.)\n",
      "Ross Me either... (He pulls up a stool so that he doesn't have to move his hand.)\n",
      "Ross (entering) Sorry I'm late, I was stuck at work. There was this big dinosaur.. thing.. anyway.\n",
      "Susan Hi.\n",
      "Carol Ross, you remember Susan.\n",
      "Ross How could I forget?\n",
      "Susan Ross.\n",
      "Ross (they shake hands) Hello, Susan. (To Carol) Good shake. Good shake. So, uh, we're just waiting for...?\n",
      "Carol Dr. Oberman.\n",
      "Ross ..Dr. Oberman. Okay. And is he-\n",
      "Susan She.\n",
      "Ross -she, of course, she- uh- familiar with our.. special situation?\n",
      "Carol Yes, and she's very supportive.\n",
      "Ross Okay, that's great. (Susan gives her drink to Carol.) No, I'm- Oh.\n",
      "Carol Thanks.\n",
      "Ross (picks up a surgical instrament and mimes a duck with it) Quack, quack..\n",
      "Carol Ross? That opens my cervix. (He drops it in horror.)\n",
      "Rachel Barry?\n",
      "Barry C'mon in.\n",
      "Rachel (hesitates) Are you sure?\n",
      "Barry Yeah! It's fine, it's fine. Robbie's gonna be here for hours.\n",
      "Robbie Huh?!\n",
      "Barry So, how ya doin?\n",
      "Rachel I'm- uh- I'm okay... You look great!\n",
      "Barry Yeah, well..\n",
      "Bernice (over intercom) Dr. Farber, Jason Greenstein's gagging.\n",
      "Barry (answering the intercom) Be right there. (To Robbie and Rachel) Be back in a sec.\n",
      "Rachel I dumped him.\n",
      "Robbie Okay.\n",
      "Ross So, um- so how's this, uh, how's this gonna work? Y'know, with us? Y'know, when, like, important decisions have to be made?\n",
      "Carol Give me a 'for instance'.\n",
      "Ross Well, uh, uh, I don't know, okay, okay, how about with the, uh, with the baby's name?\n",
      "Carol Marlon-\n",
      "Ross Marlon?!\n",
      "Carol -if it's a boy, Minnie if it's a girl.\n",
      "Ross ...As in Mouse?\n",
      "Carol As in my grandmother.\n",
      "Ross Still, you- you say Minnie, you hear Mouse. Um, how about, um.. how about Julia?\n",
      "Carol Julia..\n",
      "Susan We agreed on Minnie.\n",
      "Ross 'S'funny, um, uh, we agreed we'd spend the rest of our lives together. Things change, roll with the punches. I believe Julia's on the table..?\n",
      "Barry Sorry about that. So. What have you been up to?\n",
      "Rachel Oh, not much. I-I got a job.\n",
      "Barry Oh, that's great.\n",
      "Rachel Why are- why are you so tanned?\n",
      "Barry Oh, I, uh- I went to Aruba.\n",
      "Rachel Oh no. You went on our honeymoon alone?\n",
      "Barry No. I went with, uh.. Now, this may hurt.\n",
      "Robbie Me?!\n",
      "Barry No! (To Rachel) I went with Mindy.\n",
      "Rachel Mindy?! My maid of honour, Mindy?!\n",
      "Barry Yeah, well, uh, we're kind of a thing now.\n",
      "Rachel Oh! Well, um.. (Grabs his forehand) You've got plugs!\n",
      "Barry Careful! They haven't quite taken yet.\n",
      "Rachel And you've got lenses! But you hate sticking your finger in your eye!\n",
      "Barry Not for her. Listen, I really wanted to thank you.\n",
      "Rachel Okay..\n",
      "Barry See, about a month ago, I wanted to hurt you. More than I've ever wanted to hurt anyone in my life. And I'm an orthodontist.\n",
      "Rachel Wow.\n",
      "Barry You know, you were right? I mean, I thought we were happy. We weren't happy. But with Mindy, now I'm happy. Spit.\n",
      "Rachel What?\n",
      "Robbie Me. (Spits.)\n",
      "Rachel Anyway, um, (Gets the ring out of her purse.) I guess this belongs to you. And thank you for giving it to me.\n",
      "Barry Well, thank you for giving it back.\n",
      "Robbie Hello?!\n",
      "Susan Oh, please! What's wrong with Helen?\n",
      "Ross Helen Geller? I don't think so.\n",
      "Carol Hello? It's not gonna be Helen Geller.\n",
      "Ross Thank you!\n",
      "Carol No, I mean it's not Geller.\n",
      "Ross What, it's gonna be Helen Willick?\n",
      "Carol No, actually, um, we talked about Helen Willick-Bunch.\n",
      "Ross Well, wait a minute, wha- why is she in the title?\n",
      "Susan It's my baby too.\n",
      "Ross Oh, 's'funny, really? Um, I don't remember you making any sperm.\n",
      "Susan Yeah, and we all know what a challenge that is!\n",
      "Carol All right, you two, stop it!\n",
      "Ross No no no, she gets a credit, hey, I'm in there too.\n",
      "Carol Ross. You're not actually suggesting Helen Willick-Bunch-Geller? 'Cause I think that borders on child abuse.\n",
      "Ross Of course not, I'm... suggesting Geller-Willick-Bunch.\n",
      "Susan Oh, no, nonononono, you see what he's doing? He knows no-one's gonna say all those names, so they'll wind up calling her Geller, then he gets his way!\n",
      "Ross My way?! You-you think this is my way? Believe me, of all the ways I ever imagined this moment in my life being, this is not my way- y'know what? Uh, um, this is too hard. I'm not, I can't do-\n",
      "Dr. Oberman (entering) Knock knock!How are we today? Any nausea?\n",
      "All Yeah. Yeah. A little.\n",
      "Dr. Oberman Well, I was just wondering about the mother-to-be, but.. thanks for sharing. (To Carol) Uh, lie back..\n",
      "Ross You- uh- y'know what, I'm gonna go. I don't- I don't think I can be involved in this particular thing right now.\n",
      "Ross Oh my God.\n",
      "Susan Look at that.\n",
      "Carol I know.\n",
      "Ross Well? Isn't that amazing?\n",
      "Joey What are we supposed to be seeing here?\n",
      "Chandler I dunno, but.. I think it's about to attack the Enterprise.\n",
      "Phoebe You know, if you tilt your head to the left, and relax your eyes, it kinda looks like an old potato.\n",
      "Ross Then don't do that, alright?\n",
      "Phoebe Okay!\n",
      "Ross (walks over to where Monica is standing)Monica. Whaddya think?\n",
      "Monica (welling up) Mm-hmm.\n",
      "Ross Wh- are you welling up?\n",
      "Monica No.\n",
      "Ross You are, you're welling up.\n",
      "Monica Am not!\n",
      "Ross You're gonna be an aunt.\n",
      "Monica (pushes him and starts to cry) Oh shut up!\n",
      "Rachel (on phone) Hi, Mindy. Hi, it-it's Rachel. Yeah, I'm fine. I-I saw Barry today. Oh, yeah, yeah he-he told me. No, no, it's okay. I hope you two are very happy, I really do. Oh, oh, and Mind, y'know, if-if everything works out, and you guys end up getting married and having kids- and everything- I just hope they have his old hairline and your old nose. (Slams the phone down.) (To everyone) Okay, I know it was a cheap shot, but I feel so much better now.\n",

      "Rachel (interrupting her) Whoa-whoa-whoa-whoa! I’m sorry, semi-private? We (Laughs), we asked for a private room.\n",
      "Nurse Yes, I see that here. Unfortunately we can’t guarantee a private room and currently they’re all unavailable.\n",
      "Chandler Man, if only you’d gotten here sooner. (Ross turns and glares at him.)\n",
      "Nurse I’m sorry. Semi-private rooms are all we have.\n",

Uh, say would you umm… Would you mind checking again to see if any umm, private rooms may have (Handing her some money) opened up?\n",

      "Julie Hi. Is this your first?\n",
      "Rachel Yeah it is.\n",
      "Julie Well, little Jamie here is our third. So, if you have questions or you need anything at all, just holler.\n",
      "Rachel That’s so sweet.\n",
      "Ross Yeah.\n",
      "Rachel Oh.\n",
      "Ross Umm say, I-I opened this earlier (The privacy screen) but let me give you guys some privacy.\n",
      "Marc No nonsense! We’re all in this together.\n",
      "Julie Yeah, we are going to share every moment of this with you. And I think we’re gonna have some fun.\n",
      "Marc Yeah.\n",

      "Ross What?\n",
      "Rachel Here comes another contraction.\n",
      "Ross Oh. Okay, just breathe.\n",
      "Julie Oh honey, I think I’m having one too!\n",
      "Marc Look at this! (Takes another picture) There we go!\n",
      "Phoebe (looking at the clock) Oh wow, three hours and still no baby. Ugh, the miracle of birth sure is a snooze fest.\n",
      "Monica Hey, you wanna see something?\n",
      "Phoebe Sure! What?\n",
      "Monica Umm, this is going to be fun. Watch me freak out Chandler. Honey?\n",
      "Chandler Yeah?\n",
      "Monica Listen uh, I-I’ve been doing some thinking, and I don’t know whether it’s because we’re here or Rachel’s giving birth but umm, I think we should try to have a baby.\n",
      "Chandler Okay.\n",
      "Monica (freaking out) What-what-what’s that now?!\n",
      "Chandler Okay. I’ve been thinking about it too, and I, I think we’re ready.\n",
      "Monica What?! Are you kidding me?! You-you-you think we’re ready to have a baby now?!\n",
      "Phoebe Oh, this is fun.\n",
      "Joey You’re ready to have a baby? My boy’s all grown up!\n",
      "Chandler But you said you were ready too.\n",
      "Monica Yeah but I was just screwing with you to try to get your voice all high and weird like mine is now!\n",
      "Chandler Yes, but haven’t you wanted a kid like forever?\n",
      "Monica Okay, just back off mister! Whoa. (Pause) ‘Cause I am ready to have a baby. I just want Joey to be the father.\n",
      "Joey (voice all high and weird) What?! Are you crazy?!\n",
      "Monica That’s it! Right there! Is all I wanted!\n",
      "Marc I am so sorry. The doctor insisted on closing the curtain for the exam.\n",
      "Rachel Oh, that’s very—Really very-very okay.\n",
      "Marc Julie’s cervix is dilated a seven centimeters, that’s about four fingers. The doctor let me feel it myself.\n",
      "Julie Have you felt Rachel’s cervix Ross?\n",
      "Rachel (simultaneously as Ross) No, I don’t think we’ll be doing that.\n",
      "Ross (simultaneously as Rachel) We’re not gonna do that.\n",
      "Julie Well, if you like you can feel Rachel’s and then feel mine to compare.\n",
      "Mrs. Geller (entering) Am I interrupting?\n",
      "Ross Uh yes! Thank you.\n",
      "Rachel Oh. Oh wait no.\n",
      "Ross Later.\n",
      "Rachel No-no-don’t! Don’t leave me here with these people.\n",
      "Ross Oh uh, I’m sorry. (Runs out.)\n",
      "Rachel No Ross! Ross! Ross! My child has no father!\n",
      "Ross Hi! I’m so glad you’re here, but it’s gonna be a while. I-I wished you’d called first.\n",
      "Mrs. Geller Oh that’s all right, I’m coming back later with your father.\n",
      "Ross Oh good.\n",
      "Mrs. Geller I actually needed to talk to you before the birth.\n",
      "Ross Okay, what’s up?\n",
      "Mrs. Geller I brought something that I want to give you, assuming of course that you want it. (She holds up an engagement ring.)\n",
      "Ross Ma, you’re asking me to marry you?\n",
      "Mrs. Geller This is your grandmother’s engagement ring, I want you to give it to Rachel.\n",
      "Ross Mom no, come on! Thank you.\n",
      "Mrs. Geller Just hear me out!\n",
      "Ross N-no! Okay? We’ve been through this! We’re not gonna get married just because she’s pregnant, okay?\n",
      "Mrs. Geller Honestly! Ross, this isn’t just some girl you picked up in a bar and humped. A child should have a family.\n",
      "Ross Mom, y’know what? I-I can’t deal with this right now. I’m sorry…\n",
      "Mrs. Geller Just…think about it. If you don’t, I’ll talk more about humping.\n",
      "Ross Gimmie! (Takes the ring and puts it in his coat pocket as Rachel enters the hallway.)\n",
      "Rachel Hi!\n",
      "Mrs. Geller Oh hi dear!\n",
      "Rachel Oh, thank you so much for coming. Ross, get in here!\n",
      "Ross …she came and dragged me out of the labor room to ask me why I’m not with Rachel.\n",
      "Phoebe Yeah. (Pause) Why aren’t you with Rachel?\n",
      "Ross Are you kidding? Look, we’re not gonna be together just because we’re having a baby. Okay?\n",
      "Phoebe But y’know what? It just seems that you two belong together.\n",
      "Ross Okay, stop it! I can’t deal with this right now. I have to go have a baby.\n",
      "Phoebe Right. And with who again? (Ross exits.)\n",
      "Joey God. He’s crazy! Why doesn’t he want to be with Rachel?\n",
      "Phoebe I know!\n",
      "Joey I mean seriously, she’s like the perfect woman. I mean I know she turned me down, but if she hadn’t and wanted to be with me, I would take her in my arms and… (Realizes everyone is staring.) I haven’t bummed you guys out like this in a while have I?\n",
      "Ross (To Rachel) Hey. Who’s that?\n",
      "Rachel New people.\n",
      "Ross What happened to the Disgustingtons?\n",
      "Rachel They’re having their baby! It’s not fair Ross we got here first! Right after you left they wheeled her off into delivery. Oh but not before she gave me a juicy shot of little Jamie just crowning away.\n",
      "Ross Wow! Sorry. So uh, how are the new people?\n",
      "Rachel Well they have uh, some unusual pet names for each other. Including umm, evil bitch and uh, sick bastard. Oh God oh! Contraction!\n",
      "Ross Yeah? Okay.\n",
      "Rachel Ooh! Ow!!\n",
      "Evil Bitch Are you looking at her?!\n",
      "Sick Bastard No!\n",
      "Evil Bitch Don’t you look at her you sick bastard!\n",
      "Sick Bastard Honey I swear! I wasn’t looking at her!\n",
      "Evil Bitch She’s in labor! You like that you sick son of a bitch!\n",
      "Ross Umm. Umm, I’m-I’m just gonna—(Closes the privacy screen.)\n",
      "Evil Bitch See? See? It was because you were looking fat pervert!\n",
      "Ross No-no, I’m…I’m sure no one was looking. Just want some privacy. (He closes the screen and stares wide-eyed at Rachel.)\n",
      "Evil Bitch You miss your girlfriend?\n",
      "Ross Just ignore them.\n",
      "Rachel Ross.\n",
      "Ross What? What?\n",
      "Rachel He’s looking at me.\n",
      "Ross (to him) Hey! You wanna live to see your baby?!\n",
      "Evil Bitch Don’t you talk to my husband like that you stupid bastard!\n",
      "Monica Oh good God! If you want a baby so bad just go steal it!\n",
      "Monica What is going on with you? Since when are you so crazy about babies?\n",
      "Chandler I’m not crazy about babies. I’m crazy about us.\n",
      "Monica What?\n",
      "Chandler Look, we’ve always talked about having babies someday. I’m not saying it has to be right now, but I’m starting to think that we can handle it. We’re good. We’re really good.\n",
      "Monica We are pretty good.\n",
      "Chandler But nothing has to happen until your ready.\n",
      "Monica Well maybe I’m ready now. I mean, it’s a little scary, but maybe it’s right.\n",
      "Chandler What?! It’s not right! We’re not ready to have a kid now!!\n",
      "Monica What?!!\n",
      "Chandler I’m kidding. This is going to be fun.\n",
      "Monica So we’re gonna try? I mean, are we trying?\n",
      "Chandler We’re trying to get pregnant. (They start kissing, but Chandler stops it.) Y’know I’m not really comfortable doing this in front of the babies. So, when do you want to start trying?\n",
      "Monica Okay, hold on a sec.\n",
      "Chandler Period math?\n",
      "Monica Yeah.\n",
      "Chandler Yeah.\n",
      "Monica Well, we could start trying. Now.\n",
      "Chandler Right here?\n",
      "Monica No, not here. Maybe here.\n",
      "Chandler Wait a minute, it’s perfect. We got a lot of time to kill and we’re in a building that’s full of beds!\n",
      "Monica And it’s so clean!!\n",
      "Joey Come on you stupid machine! Come on!\n",
      "Phoebe Oh, it ate your money?\n",
      "Joey (looking at her) No.\n",
      "Phoebe All right, I’ll see you downstairs then.\n",
      "Joey All right.\n",
      "Phoebe All right.\n",
      "Joey Hey I got one! I got one!\n",
      "Man Hi!\n",
      "Phoebe Hi.\n",
      "Man Oh uh, up or down?\n",
      "Phoebe Oh down please. (The guy tries to reach the button, but can’t.) I-I hate to be a ball buster can I just do it? (She pushes the button.)\n",
      "Man Could you press up too please?\n",
      "Phoebe Sure! I feel so bad for you; I broke my leg once too.\n",
      "Man Oh yeah? How’d yours happen?\n",
      "Phoebe Well, it’s a long story. It’s kind of embarrassing. Let’s just say there was a typographical error with a sex manual. (The guy laughs.) How about you?\n",
      "Man Car accident.\n",
      "Phoebe Oh.\n",
      "Man Oh, let me guess some idiot on a cell phone wasn’t paying attention?\n",
      "Man Yeah. Me. (The elevator door opens.) Oh hey, that’s me. (Rolls onto the elevator.) Hey uh, I take it you’re just visiting someone.\n",
      "Phoebe Uh-huh, yeah.\n",
      "Man Well umm, if you have sometime y’know and maybe you might want to visit someone else…\n",
      "Phoebe Oh yeah! I-I would like that.\n",
      "Man I’m in the middle… (The elevator door closes, cutting him off.)\n",
      "Phoebe Wait! What?! No!! Elevator!! No!\n",
      "Joey (standing behind her) Uh, you gotta press the button. (Does so.)\n",
      "Ross The nurse said they’re bringing in another woman.\n",
      "Rachel Ugh, is she pregnant yet? She doesn’t need to be; she’ll still have the baby before I do. Oh Ross, another contraction! (Leans back on Ross for some support.)\n",
      "Ross That’s it. That’s it.\n",
      "Woman Oooh, that sounded like a bad one.\n",
      "Rachel Yeah it was.\n",
      "Woman Mine haven’t been so bad. Oh! Here comes one now. (Hums then squeals a little bit.) Oh, that was a big one!\n",
      "Phoebe (to the nurse) Excuse me? Could you help me with something? The patient I’m looking for has a broken leg and is in a wheelchair. And umm, he’s like early to mid-thirties, very attractive.\n",
      "Nurse I think I know who you’re talking about.\n",
      "Phoebe Oh yay! Great! Okay, what room number is he in?\n",
      "Nurse I’m sorry, that information is restricted to hospital staff…\n",
      "Joey (walks up) Uh, she’s with me. (Introduces himself) Dr. Drake Remoray.\n",
      "Nurse Dr. Drake who?\n",
      "Joey Remoray. It’s Portuguese. We need that information; I’m a doctor.\n",
      "Nurse A doctor at this hospital?\n",
      "Joey Damnit woman we’re losing precious time! Now do you want this man’s blood on your head?\n",
      "Phoebe Hands.\n",
      "Joey Hands! It is absolutely essential that you tell me what room the man my assistant described is staying in. He’s a patient of mine, I’ve been treating him for years!\n",
      "Nurse He’s in room 816.\n",
      "Joey 816, thank you!\n",
      "Phoebe Thank you. (Starts to exit.)\n",
      "Joey And what is his name?\n",
      "Phoebe (coming back for Joey) No! (Grabs Joey and drags him away.)\n",
      "Monica I think we found a place.\n",
      "Chandler Okay. (They start kissing.)\n",
      "Monica Umm, wait! Do you want to set the mood a little?\n",
      "Chandler Okay. Uh, we’ll dim the lights, dim the lights. (He goes to the light switch and finds it’s not a dimmer switch when he flips the lights off.) Or turn them out all together. Uh, no scented candles. Okay here. Here we go. (He sprays an aerosol air freshener above her.)\n",
      "Monica Okay! Okay! Make me sterile, but okay.\n",
      "Monica Okay. Let’s hurry—Oh wait! Do we have a condom? (He looks at her.) Oh right! (Laughs and they resume making out when a nurse catches them in the act.)\n",
      "Chandler Yes, 98.6. You’re gonna be fine.\n",
      "Phoebe Ooh, this is it! (Looks in the window.) Oh, that’s him! That’s him!\n",
      "Joey Great! Go get him.\n",
      "Phoebe Wait a second, or maybe you can go in first.\n",
      "Joey (looks in the window) He’s not really my type.\n",
      "Phoebe No not you, Dr. Drake Remoray. You can ask him questions and see what’s he like. People tell doctors everything.\n",
      "Joey But you said he was this great guy!\n",
      "Phoebe But lately all the guys I meet seem really nice at first, then they turn out to be the biggest jerks.\n",
      "Joey You do attract some stinkers.\n",
      "Rachel Dr. Long, I’ve been at this for seventeen hours! Three women have come and gone with their babies, you gotta give me some good news! How many centimeters am I dilated? Eight? Nine?\n",
      "Dr. Long Three.\n",
      "Ross Just three?! I’m dilated three!\n",
      "Dr. Long We are moving along, just slowly. (Rachel lies back and sighs.) Don’t worry, you’re doing great. I’ll be back soon. (Exits.)\n",
      "Rachel Hey, y’know what? I’m not waiting! I’m gonna push this baby out! I’m doing it! I mean it’s what? Three centimeters? That’s gotta be like this! (Holds her hands a couple inches apart.)\n",
      "Ross Actually it’s more like this. (Pushes her hands to less than an inch apart.)\n",
      "Rachel Oh stupid metric system!\n",
      "Doctor Oh my. We’re gonna need to take you straight to the delivery room.\n",
      "Rachel Oh for the love of God!\n",
      "Woman Giving Birth (yelling from the hallway) It’s coming! It’s coming!\n",
      "Doctor And here it is! (The baby cries.)\n",
      "Rachel Oh come on!!\n",
      "Joey Hi! I’m Dr. Drake Remoray and I have a few routine questions I need to ask you.\n",
      "Man Really? I’ve been dealing with Dr. Wells.\n",
      "Joey I know, but I’m a neurologist. And just to be on the safe side, Dr. Wells wanted a more comprehensive overview of you status so he sent me.\n",
      "Man Dr. Wells is a woman.\n",
      "Joey That was a test. Good response. All right, full name.\n",
      "Man Clifford Burnett.\n",
      "Joey Date of birth?\n",
      "Cliff November 16th, 1968.\n",
      "Joey Age?\n",
      "Cliff Can’t you figure that out based on my date of birth?\n",
      "Joey I’m a doctor Cliff, not a mathematician.\n",
      "Cliff I’m 33.\n",
      "Joey Okay. And uh, are you married.\n",
      "Cliff No.\n",
      "Joey Oh really? So, 33 and still single, would you say you have commitment issues?\n",
      "Cliff Are all the questions this personal?\n",
      "Joey (checking the list) Yes.\n",
      "Cliff Well uh if you must know I’m a widower.\n",
      "Joey Oh that’s terrible. I’m-I’m really sorry.\n",
      "Cliff Yeah.\n",
      "Joey Hmm. Do you sleep with women and never call them again?\n",
      "Cliff No.\n",
      "Joey Excellent! Excellent! And uh, finally, are you into any weird stuff y’know, sexually?\n",
      "Cliff No!\n",
      "Joey Oooh, wrong answer. (Exits.)\n",
      "Nurse (calling to the woman) This room’s available.\n",
      "Rachel Okay! Okay wait! You listen to me! You listen to me! Since I have been waiting four women, that’s four, one higher than the number of centimeters that I am dilated, have come and gone with their babies! I’m next! It’s my turn! It’s only fair! And if you bring in one woman and she has her baby before me I’m going to sue you! Not this hospital, I’m going to sue you! And my husband (Points at Ross) he’s a lawyer!\n",
      "Ross Uh Rach…\n",
      "Rachel Go get back on that case honey!\n",
      "Nurse I don’t think the next patient is very far along.\n",
      "Rachel Okay, well then bring her in.\n",
      "Woman OH….MY….GAWD!!! (Uh-huh, it’s Janice.)\n",
      "Janice I….can’t….believe this!\n",
      "Ross And yet somehow it’s true!\n",
      "Janice I mean this is so great! We’re gonna be baby buddies! (Does the laugh.)\n",
      "Ross (To Rachel) Squeeze your legs together and cover the baby’s ears!\n",
      "Man (entering, carrying a pillow) Hi sweetie!\n",
      "Janice Hi! Hi sweetheart! This is my husband Sid, I don’t think you’ve met him. Ross, Rachel, this is Sid. I nabbed him a year ago at the dermatologist’s office. Thank God for adult acne huh? (Does the laugh.)\n",
      "Sid I still can’t believe it! I’m the luckiest guy in the world!\n",
      "Ross (softly) Really?\n",
      "Sid (To Janice) What’d he say?\n",
      "Janice Oh y’know what? You have to speak very loudly when you’re talking to Sid, because he’s almost completely deaf.\n",
      "Rachel Oh!\n",
      "Ross Oh there you go!\n",
      "Rachel I get it!\n",
      "Janice So? Congratulations you two, I didn’t even know you got married.\n",

      "Phoebe You’re right, that was wrong. I’m sorry. I’m so sorry. It’s just that I liked you so much. Can we just, can we just start over?\n",
      "Cliff I don’t think so.\n",
      "Joey Uh, if I may? Umm-umm look, Cliff, you told me a lot of personal stuff about you, right? And maybe-maybe it would if-if would help if-if you knew some personal stuff about her. Uh, she was married to a gay ice dancer. Uh, she gave birth to her brother’s triplets. Oh! Oh! Her-her twin sister used to do porn!\n",
      "Phoebe Uh Joey, we’re trying to dial down the crazy.\n",
      "Joey Right!\n",
      "Phoebe Umm, look we don’t, we don’t really know each other so it would be really easy to just forget about this, but there seems to be something between us. And I don’t know about you but that doesn’t happen to me a lot.\n",
      "Cliff It doesn’t happen to me either.\n",
      "Joey Me neither.\n",
      "Dr. Long Push. Push. Come on push for five seconds. 5…4…\n",
      "Rachel 3-2-1 oh!!\n",
      "Dr. Long Okay, the next contraction should be in about twenty seconds.\n",
      "Rachel I can’t. I can’t push anymore, I can’t.\n",
      "Ross Sweetie you’re doing great.\n",
      "Rachel Oh God twenty seconds my ass!!\n",
      "Dr. Long Here we go! Okay, keep pushing! Wait! I see something.\n",
      "Ross What? You do? You do? (Looks) Oh my God!\n",
      "Rachel Don’t say, \"Oh my God!\" Oh my God what?\n",
      "Ross What is that?\n",
      "Dr. Long It’s the baby’s buttock, she’s breech.\n",
      "Ross Oh thank God, I thought she had two heads.\n",
      "Rachel Oh God. Is she gonna be okay?\n",
      "Dr. Long She’s gonna be fine. Okay, she’s in a more difficult position so you’re gonna have to push even harder now. Go! Push!\n",
      "Ross Go!\n",
      "Dr. Long Rachel you’re gonna have to push even harder, nothing’s happening!\n",
      "Rachel I’m sorry, I can’t!\n",
      "Ross Yes you can!\n",
      "Rachel I can’t!\n",
      "Ross Hey! Hey! Come on! You can! I know you can do this! Let’s go!\n",
      "Rachel I can’t. Please, you do it for me.\n",
      "Ross No! Come on let’s—One more time! One final push! Ready? 1…2…3! (Rachel pushes so hard her head snaps up head-butting Ross and knocking him down.)\n",
      "Dr. Long Good!\n",
      "Ross (from the floor) Keep pushing!\n",
      "Rachel Are you okay?\n",
      "Ross You have no idea how much this hurts. (All of the women in the room turn and glare at him.) Keep going! Keep going!\n",
      "Dr. Long Here we go!\n",
      "Ross Oh! Oh! She’s upside down but she’s coming! She’s coming!\n",
      "Rachel Oh God!\n",
      "Ross Oh! Oh my God oh! Oh my God she’s here.\n",
      "Ross Oh she’s…she’s perfect.\n",
      "Rachel Oh, she’s so tiny. (Starts crying) Where’d she go?\n",
      "Ross Oh it’s okay. They’re just-they’re just wrapping her up.\n",
      "Rachel Okay. Well be careful with her, she’s really tiny.\n",
      "Dr. Long Here she is!\n",
      "Rachel Oh hey you. Thanks for coming out of me. (The baby cries.) I know. Oh. Yeah. Oh, she’s looking at me. Hi! I know you.\n",
      "Dr. Long Do we have a name yet?\n",
      "Rachel No, not yet.\n",
      "Dr. Long That’s fine, for now we’ll just call her Baby Girl Green.\n",
      "Rachel Oh no, Baby Girl Geller-Green.\n",
      "Rachel Hello baby girl.\n",
      "Phoebe Can we come in?\n",
      "Ross Oh, come in.\n",
      "Phoebe Hi!\n",
      "Joey There she is!\n",
      "Phoebe Oh, she’s so beautiful.\n",
      "Rachel Here. (Hands her to Monica.)\n",
      "Monica Oh my God! She’s amazing. Oh, oh I’m so glad you guys got drunk and had sex!\n",
      "Chandler It’s incredible, I mean one minute she’s inside you and then 47 hours later here she is.\n",
      "Joey (taking the baby) She looks so real! (The gang looks at him.) Y’know what I mean! She’s this whole tiny little person. She already has eyelashes and knees and…uh-oh.\n",
      "Rachel What?\n",
      "Joey Oh no-no, no for I second there I counted six fingers, but one was from the other hand so we’re good.\n",
      "Phoebe Okay, my turn. My turn. (Joey hands her to Phoebe.) Oh! You’re so cute! Oh, I could squeeze your little head! (Pause) I won’t.\n",
      "Monica What’s the matter?\n",
      "Rachel Oh nothing I… Sorry, I just can’t stop crying.\n",
      "Ross The doctor says it’s completely normal with all the hormones. Plus, you-you’re sleep deprived.\n",
      "Rachel So? You guys are all sleep deprived. I don’t see you weeping because you put your slippers on the wrong feet. Oh God. (Starts to cry harder.)\n",
      "Joey What’s the matter now?\n",
      "Rachel I was reliving it.\n",
      "Phoebe Ohhh. (Hands her back to Rachel.)\n",
      "Chandler So, do you know what you’re gonna call her yet?\n",
      "Phoebe Oh, wait a minute it’s not gonna be Baby Girl? I thought that was so original!\n",
      "Ross Uh actually, we-we’ve narrowed it down to two names.\n",
      "Rachel Yeah, and y’know what? I love them both, so why don’t you just pick one and that’ll be it.\n",
      "Ross Wow! Umm, okay uh…everyone…this…is Isabella. (Rachel starts crying.) What?\n",
      "Rachel That’s not her name! I’m sorry, she just doesn’t feel like an Isabella.\n",
      "Chandler So then I guess Ferdinad is out.\n",
      "Joey What was the other one Ross?\n",
      "Ross Umm, Delilah.\n",
      "Rachel Oh great! Suddenly she sounds like a biblical whore.\n",
      "Ross So I guess we’re back to uh, Baby Girl.\n",
      "Phoebe Yay!\n",
      "Rachel Well what are we going to do?\n",
      "Monica It’s okay honey, you’ll find a name.\n",
      "Ross Ugh, easy for you to say, you already know what your kids names are going to be.\n",
      "Chandler You do?\n",
      "Monica Yeah, I’ve had them picked out since I was fourteen.\n",
      "Chandler Oh no, it’s gonna be named after some snack or baked good isn’t it?\n",
      "Rachel Well tell us! What are they?\n",
      "Monica Umm, okay. If it’s a boy it’s Daniel.\n",
      "Rachel And if it’s a girl?\n",
      "Monica I don’t want to say.\n",
      "Rachel Oh, just tell us! We’re not gonna want it!\n",
      "Monica Okay. It’s Emma.\n",
      "Rachel (gasps) Emma! (Looks at the baby and starts to cry.) See? I don’t want it.\n",
      "Monica Take it.\n",
      "Rachel What?\n",
      "Monica It’s clearly an Emma.\n",
      "Rachel Oh honey, but you love that name.\n",
      "Monica Yeah, but I love you more. Besides y’know, nothing goes with Bing. So I’m screwed. I mean… (Rachel hands Emma to Monica.) Oh, hi Emma. Yeah, that’s you. You’re our little Em. Oh what’s that honey? What? Oh, you want a little cousin? (To Chandler) You want a cousin right now?!\n",
      "Chandler That was amazing.\n",
      "Monica I know. Hey, do you realize we may have just changed our lives forever? We may have just started a family. Nine months from now we can be here, having our own baby.\n",
      "Chandler And if not, we got to do it on a bucket.\n",
      "Janice (entering) Yoo-hoo! Aaron Litman-Neurolic would like to say hello to his future bride.\n",
      "Rachel Ohhh! (Looks at Aaron and recoils in horror.) Wow! He kinda takes your breath away doesn’t he?\n",
      "Janice He’s a keeper. How are you feeling?\n",
      "Rachel Oh, I’m fine. (Gasps in pain as she sits down.)\n",
      "Janice Can I just say, I really admire what you’re doing. Just raising her all alone.\n",
      "Rachel Oh, I’m not doing it alone. I have Ross.\n",
      "Janice Oh, sure. Now. But what happens when he meets somebody else and gets married?\n",
      "Rachel Well then he gets a divorce, it’s Ross!\n",
      "Janice I’m telling you Rachel, listen to Janice. They all say they’re gonna be there until they start their real family.\n",
      "Rachel Well I—That’s never gonna happen with Ross.\n",
      "Janice Oh well that’s what I thought about my first husband, now I’m lucky if my kid gets to spend the weekend with her father and the twins and little Ms. New Boobs.\n",
      "Rachel Really?\n",
      "Janice I hate to be the one to say it, but honey you two (Her and Emma) are on your own.\n",
      "Rachel Well… That’s…y’know—That’s—We’ve been alone for the last twenty minutes we’re doing okay. Besides y’know what? I-I—Maybe we won’t be alone, ‘cause lately I-I—things have been happening between me and Ross, y’know? Right before I went into labor, we-we had this kiss. Y’know? So it might be the…the beginning of something.\n",
      "Ross (entering) Hey Janice!\n",
      "Janice Oh hi!\n",
      "Ross Who’s this little guy? (Gasps when he sees Aaron.)\n",
      "Janice Say hello to Aaron, your future son-in-law.\n",
      "Ross No-no. No.\n",
      "Janice I’m gonna leave the three of you alone.\n",
      "Ross Okay.\n",
      "Janice Bye. (Exits.)\n",
      "Ross Man! Did you see the kid on that nose?\n",
      "Rachel Uh-huh. (Ross takes off his coat and sets in on a chair.) Y’know what I was, I was thinking about?\n",
      "Ross Huh?\n",
      "Rachel Umm…that kiss before we left the apartment. That was some-something huh?\n",
      "Ross Yeah. Yeah, it really was. But we…we gotta be careful. We…we can’t let that happen again, y’know?\n",
      "Rachel (pause) Right.\n",
      "Ross I mean we don’t want to go down that road do we?\n",
      "Rachel No! No, of course not. No. That’s why I brought it up. (Pause) They didn’t have any sodas?\n",
      "Ross Oh my God! I’m sorry, I was talking to this nurse, completely forgot.\n",
      "Rachel That’s all right. (He goes to get her a soda.) And so it begins.\n",
      "Phoebe Is she in there?\n",
      "Ross Yeah. She’s putting her down now, that’s her. (Points to the nurse putting Emma now.)\n",
      "Phoebe Oh!\n",
      "Ross Look at Emma!\n",
      "Phoebe I just can’t decide who she looks more alike, you or Rachel?\n",
      "Ross Oh what are you kidding? She’s gorgeous, it’s all Rachel.\n",
      "Phoebe I’m sorry, for the last time, why aren’t you two together again? (Silence from Ross.) No, I know. I know, because you’re not in that place. Which would be fine, except you totally are.\n",
      "Ross It’s…it’s complicated okay?\n",
      "Phoebe Yeah that’s true. Yeah, you love her. You always have. You have a child together. There is no right answer.\n",
      "Ross Look, we’ve been together. Okay? And then apart, and then together, and then apart, and now we have a baby. (Pause) It’s just if-if we got together again and it didn’t work out…I could never do that to Emma. I mean she-she thinking everything—(Starts to cry.) Oh that’s…now me. What do they put something in the water in this place? Since Rachel and I we’re doing really, we’re doing really well right now.\n",
      "Phoebe I know. I know. I know. I know, and if you try to make it more you might wreck it.\n",
      "Ross Yeah, exactly.\n",
      "Phoebe Right. (Pause) Or you might get everything you’ve wanted since you were fifteen.\n",
      "Joey Hey. I just saw a woman breast feeding both of her twins at the same time; it is like a freak show up here. (Notices she’s wiping her eyes.) What’s the matter?\n",
      "Rachel Nothing.\n",
      "Joey What is it? Hey!\n",
      "Rachel Really it’s nothing. I’m just…\n",
      "Joey Rach come on, what?\n",
      "Rachel I’ve just been thinking about how my baby and I are gonna be all alone.\n",
      "Joey What are you talking about alone? What about Ross?\n",
      "Rachel Oh please, he’ll be with his real family, the twins and little miss new boobs.\n",
      "Joey Okay, how long was I watching that woman?\n",
      "Rachel I’m just saying that y’know, someday Ross is gonna meet somebody and…he’s gonna have his own life. Right?\n",
      "Joey Yeah, I guess so.\n",
      "Rachel I just never thought I would raise this baby all by myself. Pretty dumb huh?\n",
      "Joey Hey, listen to me, listen to me…you are never ever gonna be alone. Okay? I promise that’s not gonna happen.\n",
      "Rachel Joey. Honey what would I do without you?\n",
      "Joey You don’t have to worry about that okay?\n",
      "Rachel Oh, hon can you grab me my other box of tissues? They’re right on that chair under Ross’s coat.\n",
      "Joey Sure.\n",
      "Rachel Okay.\n",
      "Joey My God.\n",
      "Rachel Joey.\n",
      "Rachel (seeing the ring) Oh my God. (Pause) Okay.\n",

      "Chandler Yeah. We don't feel like we can host Thanksgiving this year.\n",
      "All What?\n",
      "Phoebe Hey!\n",
      "Ross Are you kidding?\n",
      "Chandler Well, it's just with uhm, work and the stress of adoption, we just don't feel like we have the energy. Plus, we don't think it's fair that every year the burden falls on us.\n",
      "Ross (skeptical) That doesn't sound like you... That's Monica talking!\n",
      "Chandler No, no! We made this decision together.\n",
      "Ross She's putting words in your mouth!\n",
      "Joey Don't you put words in people's mouths, you put turkey in people's mouths!\n",
      "Rachel I can't believe this! This is Emma's first Thanksgiving!\n",
      "Monica No, it's not!\n",
      "Rachel It's not? (whispering to Ross) When was she born?\n",
      "Phoebe Well, personally I think it's great you're giving yourself a break.\n",
      "Monica Thank you, Pheebs!\n",
      "Phoebe Sure. It's just as well... I mean, last year wasn't very good. I think she's losing her touch.\n",
      "Monica What? You are way off, lady!\n",
      "Phoebe Am I? Really? Am I? Well, why don't you cook Thanksgiving dinner and prove me wrong! Well, think about it, think about it, you'll be trying to top than you did last year. You'd be in competition... with yourself.\n",
      "Monica That's my favourite kind! Okay, we are doing this!\n",
      "Chandler Don't let yourself get manipulated this way!\n",
      "Monica Hey, stay out of this, Chandler! This is between me... and ME!\n",
      "Chandler We are supposed to make these decisions together! Did you not watch the Doctor Phil I taped for you?\n",
      "Phoebe Hey!\n",
      "Rachel Hi! Happy Thanksgiving!\n",
      "Phoebe Oh, yeah, happy needless-turkey-murder day.\n",
      "Monica You guys, I ordered some chocolate pies from that bakery on Bleecker. Could you pick them up for me?\n",
      "Phoebe You're not making the pies yourself?\n",
      "Monica No, no, no, I don't make chocolate pies. When I was younger I-I enter in this pie-eating contest. I ate so many that just the thought of them made me sick.\n",
      "Rachel Did you at least win the contest?\n",
      "Monica 2 minutes, 12 pies and a part of one tin! Okay, I see you guys at 4.\n",
      "Rachel Can't wait!\n",

      "Phoebe What's Emma doing today?\n",
      "Rachel Well, let's see... uh... I know that she has a meeting with her lawyer and then she has to make a very big poop. Why?\n",
      "Phoebe Well, I wanna enter her in a baby beauty pageant.\n",
      "Rachel Oh my God! That's the creepiest thing I've ever heard!\n",
      "Phoebe Okay, but, well, before you say no, my friend Susanne is entering her kid and compared to Emma she's a real dog!\n",
      "Rachel Oh! Phoebe, all babies are beautiful!\n",
      "Phoebe (sarcastic) Oh... okay.\n",
      "Rachel Phoebe, just the idea of pitting one baby against another, I mean, you know, and judging who's cuter just for a trophy...\n",
      "Rachel And a thousand dollars.\n",
      "Rachel ...is something I'm very interested in! Oh please, do not tell Ross. He still believes that (in a deep voice, mocking Ross) what's in the inside is important...\n",
      "Phoebe Okay, oh, and Emma needs a cowgirl outfit for the competition.\n",
      "Rachel Where am I gonna get a cowgirl outfit on Thanksgiving?\n",
      "Phoebe Well, I was thinking...\n",
      "Rachel Oh, take the clothes of Joey's Cabbage Patch Kid.\n",
      "Phoebe Yeah!\n",

      "Monica You don't know that.\n",
      "Chandler Somebody is gonna pick us.\n",
      "Monica Yeah, but we haven't heard a thing from the adoption agency and it has been weeks!\n",
      "Chandler I'm telling ya! It's gonna happen. Next year it's gonna be you, me and the little Hemingway Bing. (pause) What, he's my favourite author!\n",
      "Monica Name one of his books.\n",
      "Chandler (after a long pause) \"The Firm\"?\n",
      "Monica Ok, let's see... uhm, okay, the turkey is in the oven, the stuffing is ready...\n",
      "Chandler You know, you always cook this meal all by yourself. Let me help this year.\n",
      "Monica Oh, Chandler, that's sweet. But you don't have to do everything Doctor Phil tells you to do.\n",
      "Chandler I'm serious, let me do something, just not the turkey or the stuffing, nothing \"high profile\".\n",
      "Monica Ok, let's see... Oh, the cranberry sauce, it is easy to make and no-one really cares about it.\n",
      "Chandler Tell me more.\n",
      "Monica Okay, I'm gonna go check on something across the hall. You start by washing these (she gives Chandler a bowl with cranberries. Then, while she's going outside, she sees him with a bottle of soap in his hands) Not with soap!! (she leaves)\n",
      "Chandler You obviously haven't tasted my Palmolive potatoes!\n",

      "Chandler Hmm, the game's at one.\n",
      "Ross So?\n",
      "Chandler Dinner is at four, we'll never gonna make it back.\n",
      "Joey So we'll leave before it's over, we'll be back in time.\n",
      "Chandler You say that now, but it could take us a long time to get back home. Plus Joey could get lost and and they could have to page us to go pick him up.\n",
      "Joey Dude, two times that happened!\n",
      "Chandler Look, Monica has been working hard all day, she didn't wanna host this thing in the first place, we shouldn't go!\n",
      "Ross He's right, man.\n",
      "Joey Right, I guess. Alright, so see you at four.\n",
      "Chandler Okay. (pause) And get ready to taste my very special cranberries. Or should I say... chanberries!\n",
      "Joey That's some gentle comedy, dude. (he and Ross leave)\n",
      "Ross We're still going at the game, right?\n",
      "Joey Yeah!\n",
      "Ross Yeah.\n",
      "Host This is contestant number sixteen, Rebecca...\n",
      "Phoebe Hey.\n",
      "Rachel Oh Phoebe, listen. Well, I think we gotta go. This place is really freaking me out. I've been watching this guy over there, I don't think he came with a kid!\n",
      "Phoebe We can't leave now! There was this one baby, Haley, who was favourite to win and she got croup, so she had to stay home! This competition just blew wide open, folks!\n",
      "Rachel Phoebe, I think... It's just too weird, I just saw a one year old running around with pantyhose on!\n",
      "Phoebe Oh, I know, we should have been more prepared. (she looks around) It's okay. Now, the way I see it, our real competition now is Cameron. Oh my God, they just took her sweater off. Look at those arms! Hello Michelin Man.\n",
      "Rachel Oh, Phoebe! Come on! You know what, it's already three o'clock and they haven't even gotten to Emma's group yet. We gotta go, we got dinner!\n",
      "Phoebe (panicking) But Emma's got what it takes, she could go all the way!\n",
      "Rachel Phoebe, you have to calm down.\n",
      "Phoebe Okay. Rachel, the hottest babies in the Tri-State Area are in this room right now! I overheard one of the judges say that not one of them holds a candle to Emma!\n",
      "Rachel Really?\n",
      "Phoebe Yeah!\n",
      "Rachel You heard them say that?\n",
      "Phoebe Yeah!\n",
      "Rachel All right, okay. Alright, let's give to these babies something to cry about!\n",
      "Phoebe Good! Oh yay! Let's get down to business! Emma needs some makeup!\n",
      "Rachel No, what?\n",
      "Phoebe Well, she's gonna look all washed out next to the other contestants!\n",
      "Rachel No Phoebe, I am not letting you put makeup on my baby!\n",
      "Phoebe Why not!\n",
      "Rachel Because I already did!\n",
      "Joey Oh, Bob, get off the guy!\n",
      "Ross Oh! What a game, huh?\n",
      "Joey I know, yeah.\n",
      "Ross I can't believe Chandler is missing this!\n",
      "Joey Yeah. I am sorry he's not here too, but I got to say, (takes some nachos from a plate on the seat where Chandler should have been) I am really enjoying Nacho Chair.\n",
      "Ross Yeah, I'd probably enjoy it more if you didn't keep batting my hand away.\n",
      "Joey Ohhhh! These seats are great!\n",
      "Ross I know, I know! When I was here for Holidays on Ice (Joey looks around worried hoping no one heard that) I was sitting so far away Michelle Kwan couldn't read my banner!\n",
      "Joey (looks at the time) Wow, hey, we'd better get going. If we don't leave right now, we'll be late for dinner.\n",
      "Ross Oh, but it's a kind game! So we're a little late, you know, the girls will be there, let's stay just for one more goal.\n",
      "Joey I don't know...\n",
      "Ross One more fight!\n",
      "Joey Okay.\n",
      "Ross Okay.\n",
      "Monica Where is everybody? They're forty-five minutes late!\n",

      "Joey How late are we?\n",
      "Ross Forty-five minutes.\n",
      "Joey Wow (He opens his apartment door and throws their stuff in.)\n",
      "Ross (handing him his coat) Here!\n",
      "Joey Okay. Rachel and Phoebe are already there, okay? So they probably started without us. We could just slip in and no-one needs to know where we were! (he raises his hands and on his right one there's a Rangers foam finger)\n",
      "Ross You may want to lose the foam finger!\n",
      "Joey Oh, no, no, no, no, no. You just want to put it on your hand!\n",
      "Ross Hey!\n",
      "Phoebe Oh!\n",
      "Joey You are not at Thanksgiving?\n",
      "Rachel No...\n",
      "Phoebe No, we're late!\n",
      "Rachel What are you doing here!\n",
      "Ross We're late too! (Rachel screams)\n",
      "Joey We figured we could be late because you guys were gonna be on time (he points the foam finger at the girls)\n",
      "Phoebe Don't point that thing at me, Tribbiani!\n",
      "Ross So, nobody's here? Monica's gonna kill us!\n",
      "Joey Yeah, where were you!\n",
      "Ross Yeah, yeah, what's with the trophy!\n",
      "Phoebe Uh, we were at the Spelling Bee!\n",
      "Rachel And I won!\n",
      "Ross You won an adult Thanksgiving day spelling bee.\n",
      "Rachel Yes! (spells it) Y-E-S. Yes!\n",
      "Ross Let me see this... (he takes the trophy from Rachel's hands) Grand Supreme Little Darling, New York Division.\n",
      "Rachel Yeah. That's me!\n",
      "Ross You entered Emma into a Beauty Pageant?\n",
      "Phoebe And it looks like she put makeup on her!\n",
      "Joey Wait a second, wait a second, where have I seen that cowgirl outfit before...\n",
      "Ross I can't believe this, she's our daughter! That you would treat her like some kind of showdog is inexcusable!\n",
      "Rachel She won a thousand dollars!\n",
      "Ross So this is an annual thing?\n",
      "Joey (realizing) Oh! That's Alicia Mae Emory's outfit!\n",
      "Phoebe You guys, there are people in there who are not getting any happier!\n",
      "Ross Yeah. What are we gonna do?\n",
      "Rachel Well, I don't know, you guys figure it out, I got to put Emma down for a nap.\n",
      "Joey All right. Hey Rach, while you're in there, throw something on Alicia Mae.\n",
      "Phoebe Alright, what are we gonna say?\n",
      "Ross Ooh, we'll say that we were mugged! You can't get mad at someone who's been mugged!\n",
      "Phoebe Oh, good, that's good, but you don't look like you were mugged!\n",
      "Joey No. Here (he tears off the pocket from Ross' shirt, and tears off everything below that as well.)\n",
      "Ross (to Joey) HEY!\n",
      "Monica Do you hear something? (Chandlers stands up and goes to the door to look out from the peephole)\n",
      "Chandler (peeping) They're out there!\n",
      "Monica Ohhh! Let me see! Oh God, I can't believe this! They're an hour late and they're just staying out there, talking!\n",
      "Chandler (peeping) Everything is so distorted! Looks like Joey has a giant hand! Which says \"Rangers\" on it. They went to the game!\n",
      "Monica (gasps) Oooh! They are in for a world of pain!\n",
      "Chandler (looking through the peephole again) Ross' shirt is torn.\n",
      "Monica Oh! They're late and they're sloppy!\n",
      "Rachel Alright, Emma is napping... (then to Ross) what happened to your shirt?\n",
      "Ross I got mugged. And they stole my pocket.\n",
      "Phoebe We're just... we're trying to figure out an excuse. Hey! Ooh! How about this: We can say that Monica told us 5 o'clock, not 4 o'clock. That way we're right on time! (Others start to agree but she continues) OR... or, we can plant PCP in the apartment and call the cops on her.\n",
      "Ross (sarcastic) That would be a good way to get rid of all the PCP we have lying around.\n",
      "Rachel You know what, we just say that she said it was 5 o'clock. We'll just act casual. We're not late, we're right on time. (When she finishes talking, a note is pushed from under Monica's and Chandler's door, into the hall. Ross picks it up and reads it out loud)\n",
      "Ross (Reading the note) We know you're out there. (Rachel gasps)\n",
      "Joey (whispering) Who do you think its from?\n",
      "Rachel Oh, God. This is bad. This is so bad.\n",
      "Ross Well, let's just go in there and face them.\n",
      "Phoebe Well, I'm not going in first. I bet that vein on Monica's forehead is popping like crazy.\n",
      "Joey I hate that thing, it's like a... bolt of lightning.\n",
      "Rachel Oh, hey, I have an idea. Why don't we play rock-paper-scissors, and whoever loses goes in first. (they all agree) Ready? (they do the rock-paper-scissor thing with they hands and Rachel has paper, Phoebe and Ross both have rock, while Joey is doing a strange upward wiggling with his fingers. They all look a him confused).\n",
      "Joey (smiling from ear to ear) Ah-haah! I win!!\n",
      "Ross What is that?\n",
      "Joey That's fire. Beats everything.\n",
      "Phoebe Oh, really? Does it beat water balloon? (She places her hand over his \"fire\" and mimics a bursting water balloon, thus putting the fire out).\n",
      "Joey Ooh! Well played, Phoebe Buffay, well played.\n",
      "Rachel Alright, enough, enough, come on. Let's just all go in at the same time.\n",
      "All Alright, okay. (Phoebe reaches for the door, and tries to open it but it's locked)\n",
      "Phoebe It's locked.\n",
      "Ross Wha...? Oh sure, now they lock it, but when they're having sex on the couch, its like: \"Come on in, my butt is surprisingly hairy\".\n",
      "Rachel Alright, come on... (starts to knock on the door) Alright, you guys. We're so sorry we're late. Please let us in, so we can have dinner together.\n",
      "Monica No! Everything's cold. The turkey's dried out and the... the stuffing is all soggy.\n",
      "Chandler Yeah, and there's a bowl of cranberry sauce that... (speaking lower to Monica) what happens to cranberry sauce?\n",
      "Monica (Rolling her eyes) Nothing. It's fine.\n",
      "Chandler (relieved) Oh thank God!\n",
      "Ross Come on you guys, we're sorry, alri...? Our subway broke down.\n",
      "Chandler (looking through the peephole) That's a lie, you went to the game, I can see Joey's hand.\n",
      "Ross (to Joey, who is wearing a blue, 3 foot hand) FOR THE LOVE OF GOD TAKE IT OFF!! (takes it off his hand and throws it on the floor)\n",
      "Rachel You guys, come on, it doesn't matter why we're late. We're all here now, please let us in so we can have some of your delicious turkey. (A slice of turkey on a piece of aluminum foil is slid under door)\n",
      "Joey I had a dream once about a fax machine that did that. (Ross picks it up)\n",
      "Monica That's all the turkey you're gonna get.\n",
      "Ross How are we gonna decide who gets this?\n",
      "Joey (holds his fist up) WATER BALLOON! (he stuffs the slice in is mouth and gives the foil back to Ross)\n",
      "Phoebe What are we gonna do? I'm starving.\n",
      "Rachel (gasps) Oh, I just remembered. We do have something to eat. Monica put something in our oven this morning.\n",
      "Phoebe Oh yeah!\n",
      "Monica Hey, you touch that and you will be sorry.\n",
      "Chandler Guys, I'd listen to her. The vein is bigger than I've ever seen it. (Monica looks at Chandler)\n",
      "Rachel Huh... OH MY GOD IT'S BRUSSELS SPROUTS. (they all look appalled)\n",
      "Ross That's worse than no food.\n",
      "Chandler HA-HA! All you got was Monica's stinky Brussels sprouts!\n",
      "Monica Stinky?!\n",
      "Chandler Please let me stay on this side of the door.\n",
      "Rachel Oh, I know... I still have my old key! (She goes in to get it and comes back with her keys) We can just unlock the door.\n",
      "Phoebe Well, I don't know if that's such a good idea. They clearly don't want to be with us.\n",
      "Rachel You know what? I don't want to be with them either, but it's Thanksgiving and we should not want to be together, together. (Goes to unlock the door)\n",
      "Joey (to Ross) Just get in there and make a face to face apology, you know? Look them in the eye. I know I can get them to forgive us.\n",
      "Ross I don't know...\n",
      "Joey I'm telling ya... (his eyes open wide and he looks like his eyes are about to pop out. He stares at Ross like this without blinking) I can do it.\n",
      "Ross (Staring back, and then breaks off) (To Phoebe and Rachel) Yeah, he can do it!\n",
      "Rachel Oh!\n",
      "Joey Oh! It all looks so beautiful: the turkey, the stuffing...\n",
      "Chandler The cranberries...?\n",
      "Monica Oh! Enough! A monkey could have made 'em!\n",
      "Joey (still with his door wedged in the door gap, now opens his eyes wide and stares at Monica and Chandler as he did with Ross earlier in the hall) Hey listen guys, we feel really terrible.\n",
      "Chandler He's doing that weird eye contact thing. Don't look at him, don't look at him! (They both look away)\n",
      "Joey Come on you guys, we want you to know we're (His eye widen even more) very very sorry. (Monica and Chandler are now covering their eyes with their hands) (then to the others in the hall) Right guys?\n",
      "Ross I feel terrible.\n",
      "Phoebe and Rachel So, so sorry.\n",
      "Joey (smiling) Now let's not ruin this day. You worked so hard. Let's move past this and try to have a nice meal all together, huh?\n",
      "Chandler The floating heads do make a good point.\n",
      "Monica Yeah, they do seem to feel pretty bad.\n",
      "Rachel So bad.\n",
      "Ross So bad.\n",
      "Phoebe So bad.\n",
      "Monica (Gets up) Okay, okay. You two (to Phoebe and Rachel) go get the dessert. And I'll let you in.\n",
      "Rachel Dessert?\n",
      "Monica Yeah, I asked you and Phoebe to pick up the pies. You did remember, right?\n",
      "Phoebe Pies, oh, we thought you said priiiize (goes to the hall and comes back with Emma's trophy in her hand). Here! (gives it to Monica).\n",
      "Monica Grand Supreme Little Darling?\n",
      "Rachel Congratulatioooons!\n",
      "Monica Oh my God! YOU FORGOT THE PIES? Well, I cannot believe this. You force me to make dinner, then you're an hour late and you forget the one little thing that I asked you to do.\n",
      "Ross Really girls, not cool.\n",
      "Chandler Well, you manheads aren't any better. You lied about going to the game. You knew it would make you late, and you still went anyway.\n",
      "Joey Hey! I'm getting a little tired of this okay? We said we're sorry. It's Thanksgiving for Pete's sakes! A day of forgiveness!\n",
      "Ross It's a day to be thankful.\n",
      "Joey (to Ross, mouthing) Don't make me come up there!\n",
      "Monica It's too late for apologies.\n",
      "Joey Fine! Let's just go. I don't need your stupid dinner.\n",
      "Chandler That would be a lot more convincing if you weren't drooling.\n",
      "Rachel Ewww, is that what that is?\n",
      "Joey Sorry!\n",
      "Phoebe Come on you guys, let's just do our own Thanksgiving.\n",
      "Rachel Yeah! I'll cook!\n",
      "Ross Yeah! Let's go out.\n",
      "Rachel Hey!\n",
      "Joey Yeah! You three have a nice Thanksgiving.\n",
      "Monica The three of us?\n",
      "Joey Yeah! You, Chan, and the vein!\n",
      "Joey Ha!\n",
      "Joey Oh-oh! I'm stuck!\n",
      "Monica Joey, that is not gonna work.\n",
      "Joey No seriously... I'm really wedged in here.\n",
      "Phoebe I'll pull you through.\n",
      "Ross Okay.\n",
      "Joey (in agony) aaw-ahhh-aaahhh STOP! STOP! I'm worried about damaging my head.\n",
      "Chandler A little late for that.\n",
      "Joey Alright, hurry up, you gotta do something.\n",
      "Monica Alright, well, this does not change anything. (to Chandler) Okay, we need to get something to grease the sides of his face.\n",
      "Chandler Uhm, we've got turkey grease.\n",
      "Monica Bring it.\n",
      "Joey I just wanna say that I'm sorry I referred to the vein as a seperate person...\n",
      "Monica Here you go!\n",
      "Joey Oh, that smells good!\n",
      "Joey Okay.\n",
      "Monica Okay, try it.\n",
      "Joey It isn't working.\n",
      "Monica Alright, we're gonna have to unscrew the chain.\n",
      "Joey Well hurry, I can't feel my ears!\n",
      "Chandler Can you ever feel your ears?\n",
      "Joey Interesting...\n",
      "Monica Chandler, where are your tools?\n",
      "Chandler (sarcastically) Oh, I left them on my bulldozer... I don't have tools!\n",
      "Monica I do, but Rachel borrowed them.\n",
      "Rachel I lent them to Ross.\n",
      "Ross I gave them to Joey.\n",
      "Joey I left them at the park.\n",
      "Monica Oh!\n",
      "Ross (looking at Joey's butt) I'm finding it really hard not to mess with him.\n",
      "Phoebe I've already stuffed a bunch of Brussel sprouts down his pants.\n",
      "Ross Nice!\n",
      "Monica Okay, I have to get that. Now when I get back, I want you and your friends to be gone. Thanksgiving is over. The Vein has spoken.\n",
      "Joey It's really starting to hurt.\n",
      "Chandler Okay, look, I'm gonna pull on the door and you guys push as hard as you can. Maybe we can get enough room to wiggle him out, okay? Okay, so PUSH!\n",
      "Phoebe Just a sec., we're kind in the middle of something here.\n",
      "Joey Ooh! Stop putting things down my pants!\n",
      "Chandler Come on guys, PUSH!\n",
      "Joey Yeah! Come on!\n",
      "Joey and Chandler PUSH! PUSH! PUSH!\n",
      "Chandler My cranberries!\n",

      "Chandler (to Monica) Look! Look! Look what the... Look what... Look what the floating heads did!\n",
      "Monica (very emotional) I don't care.\n",
      "Chandler What's going on?\n",
      "Monica That was the adoption agency...\n",
      "Chandler And?\n",
      "Monica WE'RE GETTING A BABY!\n",
      "Chandler Are you serious? (they hug)\n",
      "Monica There's a pregnant woman in Ohio, and she picked us!\n",
      "Rachel I'm so happy for you!\n",
      "Monica This Thanksgiving kicks last Thanksgiving's ass!\n",
      "Rachel To Monica and Chandler... and that knocked up girl in Ohio.\n",
      "Ross I'm just so happy you guys are finally getting a kid.\n",
      "Phoebe I know. Have you considered pageanting?\n",
      "Monica I can't believe they called, and we're actually getting a baby. (she kisses Chandler)\n",
      "Joey Oh, I know how you feel...\n",
      "Rachel Really?\n",
      "Joey Sure. I went through the exact same thing with Alicia Mae Emory... The waiting, the wandering... Then one day... I get that call from Toys \"R\" Us... She was in stock!\n",

      "Chandler What is it?\n",
      "Joanna Just a little gag gift somebody gave me. (She’s holding a pair of handcuffs) Put your hands together.\n",
      "Chandler Ah-ha, you’re not the boss of me. (She kisses him) Yeah, you are! (She handcuffs him to the chair) Ooh, saucy.\n",
      "Joanna (kisses him) I’ll be back in ten minutes. (Starts to leave)\n",
      "Chandler You are, you’re gonna leave me like this?\n",
      "Joanna Knowing you’re here, waiting for me I think it’s kinda exciting.\n",
      "Chandler Okay. But if you don’t come back soon, (She leaves and closes the door) there’s pretty much nothing I can do about it!\n",
      "Joanna (locking her door) Oh.\n",
      "Sophie Hi! I brought you back a macaroon!\n",
      "Joanna Oh great! I’ll keep it in my butt with your nose. (She grabs the cookie and walks out.)\n",
      "Rachel That’s weird, she locked the door.\n",
      "Sophie Y’know why? She’s got the Christmas bonus list in there. I saw her working on it this morning.\n",
      "Rachel Okay, swear you won’t tell, but when Mark left he gave me a key to Joanna’s office. Do you wanna see the list?\n",
      "Sophie Yeah!\n",
      "Chandler Hi! (to Sophie) How are you?\n",
      "Chandler Hello, Joanna…(Realises he doesn’t know her last name)…’s office.\n",
      "Joanna (on speaker phone) I’m really sorry but I may be a little while longer.\n",
      "Chandler How little?!\n",
      "Joanna A couple of hours, I feel awful.\n",
      "Chandler Look, this isn’t funny! You get back here right now!\n",
      "Joanna I can’t!!\n",
      "Chandler Why not?!\n",
      "Joanna I’m in my boss’s car!\n",
      "Chandler What?!\n",
      "Joanna Uh-oh, tunnel. (The phone gets cut off)\n",
      "Rachel (answering it) (angrily) What?!\n",
      "Chandler (in a serious, businesslike tone) Rachel, could I see you for a moment?\n",
      "Chandler Okay, here’s the situation. The keys to the cuffs are on the back of the door. Could you be a doll and grab them and scoot on over and unlock me? And on a totally different subject, that is a lovely pantsuit.\n",
      "Rachel You promised you would break up with her!\n",
      "Chandler I did break up with her! She just took it really, really well!\n",
      "Rachel And the fact that you were jeopardising my career never entered your mind?!\n",
      "Chandler It did enter my mind! But then something happened that made it, shoot right out.\n",
      "Rachel Y'know what Chandler, you got yourself into those cuffs, you get yourself out of them.\n",
      "Chandler No-no-no-no-no-no-no!! I can’t get myself right out of them! You must have me confused with the Amazing Chandler!! Come on, you have to unlock me, she could be gone for hours, and I’m cold, and (Stops and looks up the skirt on a statue behind Joanna’s desk.)\n",
      "Rachel Oh, Chandler!! All right, this is it! (Grabs the key) You never see Joanna again!\n",
      "Chandler Never!\n",
      "Rachel You never come into this office again!\n",
      "Chandler Fine!\n",
      "Rachel You give me back my Walkman!\n",
      "Chandler I—never borrowed your Walkman.\n",
      "Rachel Well, then I lost it. You buy me one!\n",
      "Chandler You got it! Here we go! Come on! This is great! (Rachel goes over and unlocks the handcuffs) Ahhh! (He starts rubbing his wrist)\n",
      "Rachel Does it hurt?\n",
      "Chandler No, I just always see guys doing this when they get handcuffs taken off them. (He runs over to where his pants are hanging) Hello sweet pants!\n",
      "Rachel Wait a minute! What are you gonna tell Joanna?\n",
      "Chandler About what?\n",
      "Rachel When she sees that you’re gone, she’s gonna know that I let you out, and that I was in here, and I’m gonna get fired!\n",
      "Chandler I’ll make something up! I’m good at lying, I actually did borrow your Walkman!\n",
      "Rachel No, there’s nothing to make up, she’s gonna know that I have a key to her office, I’ve got to get you locked up back the way you were! (She tries to drag him over to the chair, but Chandler stops her.)\n",
      "Chandler Oh-ho-ho, I don’t think so!\n",
      "Chandler Well, this is much better.\n",
      "The Salesman So, here’s somebody interesting, Joey. What do you know about Van Gogh?\n",
      "Joey He cut off his ear.\n",
      "The Salesman And?\n",
      "Joey I’m out.\n",
      "The Salesman He painted that. (Points to one of his paintings in the book)\n",
      "Joey Wow! That’s pretty nice. I thought he cut off his ear ‘cause he sucked. What else you got in there?\n",
      "The Salesman Let’s see, ahhh… Where does the Pope live?\n",
      "Joey In the woods. No wait-wait, that’s the joke answer.\n",
      "The Salesman Actually its, Vatican City. Now ahh, what do you know about vulcanised rubber?\n",
      "Joey Spock’s birth control.\n",
      "The Salesman (laughs) You need these books.\n",
      "Phoebe Hey!\n",
      "Monica Hi.\n",
      "Phoebe This used to be your room? (She nods ‘Yes’) Wow! You must’ve been in really good shape as a kid.\n",
      "Monica Ohh, I’m such an idiot. I can’t believe I actually thought she could change.\n",
      "Phoebe Well, who cares what your Mom thinks? So you pulled a Monica.\n",
      "Monica Oh good, I’m glad that’s catching on.\n",
      "Phoebe No but, why does that have to be a bad thing. Just change what it means. Y'know? Go down there and prove your Mother wrong. Finish the job you were hired to do, and we’ll call that pulling a Monica.\n",
      "Monica What?\n",
      "Phoebe Okay, umm, if a kid gets straight A’s, his parents would say, \"Yeah, he pulled a Monica.\" Y'know? Or a fireman saves a baby, and they go, \"Yeah I know, he pulled a Monica.\" Or someone hits a homerun and the announcer says, \"Yeah, that one’s outta here.\" Though some things don’t change.\n",
      "Monica (getting up) All right, I’ll go down there. But, I’m not gonna serve the lasagna. I’m gonna serve something I make.\n",
      "Phoebe Wow! My breasts are really strong. (She goes and joins Monica.)\n",
      "Rachel Chandler! Chandler, please, I have to get you locked up back the way you were, I am sooo gonna lose my job, she’s very private about her office. Now I know why.\n",
      "Chandler Hey, look, you’re in trouble either way! Okay? If she comes back and sees me locked to this instead of the chair, she’s gonna know you were in here. So you might as well just let me go.\n",
      "Rachel What if I clean your bathroom for a month?\n",
      "Chandler It still wouldn’t be clean. (Rachel makes an ‘Eww, disgusting!’ face) All I want is my freedom.\n",
      "Rachel Foot rubs for a month!\n",
      "Chandler Freedom!\n",
      "Rachel I’ll take all of your photos and put them into photo albums!\n",
      "Chandler Freedom! I want my freedom! Why won’t you here me?! (Opens the door) Sophie, help me! Help me!! (Sophie stands up)\n",
      "Rachel Sophie sit!!\n",
      "Rachel No! God, would you just calm down!\n",
      "Chandler I’m gonna say this for the last time. Would you please just… (He moves his arm which opens the drawer and hits in the back of the head, which proves his point.)\n",
      "Joey Wow! There’s a lot I didn’t know about vomit. (The duck comes to the door of the bathroom, quacking.) (To the duck) In a minute. (The duck goes back into the bathroom.)\n",
      "The Salesman So, what do you say, Joey? You get the whole set of encyclopedias for twelve hundred dollars, which works out to just 50 bucks a book!\n",
      "Joey Twelve hundred dollars? You think I have $1200? I’m home in the middle of the day, and I got patio furniture in my living room. I guess there’s a few things you don’t get from book learnin’.\n",
      "The Salesman Well ah, what can you swing?\n",
      "Joey How about zero down and zero a month for a long, long time?\n",
      "The Salesman You don’t have, anything?\n",
      "Joey You wanna see what I got? (He gets up to empty out his pockets) Okay? I’ve got a baby Tootsie Roll, a movie stub, keys, a Kleenex, a rock, and an army man. Hey!\n",
      "The Salesman Okay, I-I get the picture. Uh, thanks, for your time. (Starts to leave)\n",
      "Joey And a 50. (The salesman stops suddenly) Huh, these must be Chandler’s pants.\n",
      "The Salesman For 50 bucks, you can get one book! What will it be? A? B? C?\n",
      "Joey Oh, I-I think I’m gonna stick with the V, I wanna see how this bad boy turns out.\n",
      "Rachel I ah, will buy and wrap all of your Christmas gifts.\n",
      "Chandler No!\n",
      "Rachel I ah… Oh! I’ll squeeze you fresh orange juice every morning!\n",
      "Chandler With extra pulp?\n",
      "Rachel (happily) Yeah!!\n",
      "Chandler No!\n",
      "Rachel D’oh!! (pause) I’ve got it!\n",
      "Chandler You don’t have it.\n",
      "Rachel I have so got it. There’s gonna be rumours about this, there’s no way to stop it. Sophie knows, Monica and Phoebe know.\n",
      "Chandler How do Monica and Phoebe know?\n",
      "Rachel Oh, I called them. And when they ask me what I saw, I can be very generous (Holds her hands far apart) or very (In a high pitched voice) stingy.\n",
      "Chandler (intrigued) Go on.\n",
      "Rachel I can make you a legend. I can make you this generation’s Milton Berle.\n",
      "Chandler And Milton Berle has a…\n",
      "Rachel Ohh, not compared to you. (Chandler nods in agreement)\n",
      "Monica Well?\n",
      "Phoebe They’re not even touching the lasagna!\n",
      "Monica Really?!\n",
      "Phoebe Oh, they love your casserole.\n",
      "Monica Yes!!\n",
      "Phoebe It’s hard to believe that just a little while ago this was nothing but ingredients.\n",
      "Mrs. Geller (entering) Well, everyone seems to be enjoying your dish.\n",
      "Monica And you?\n",
      "Mrs. Geller I thought it was… quite tasty.\n",
      "Monica So if everyone liked it, and you liked it, that would make this a success. Which would make you…\n",
      "Mrs. Geller (interrupting) A bitch?\n",
      "Monica Well, I was going for wrong, but we can use your word.\n",
      "Mrs. Geller Yes, well I was wrong, and I have to say you really impressed me today.\n",
      "Monica Wow!\n",
      "Phoebe Umm, you might even say that she pulled a Monica. (They both look at her) (to Monica) She doesn’t know we switched it. (Monica nods her head ‘No.’)\n",
      "Mrs. Geller And the next time you cater for me, there will be nothing but ice in the freezer. (She starts to bite her nails)\n",
      "Monica That really means a lot. Oh, and Mom, don’t bite your nails.\n",
      "Chandler (hello) Hello.\n",
      "Joey, Rachel, and Ross Hey!\n",
      "Monica (in a sexy voice) Hello, Chandler. (Phoebe has a huge smile on her face.)\n",
      "Chandler (to Rachel) I love you. (Kisses her on the forehead)\n",
      "Joey Wh-what’s going on?\n",
      "Phoebe Oh.\n",
      "Joey No he doesn’t!\n",
      "Chandler (checks his watch) Two hours, that lasted!\n",
      "Rachel So did you break up with Joanna?\n",
      "Chandler I think so.\n",
      "Joey Well, it’s good thing you got out when you did, before she blew up like that Vesuvius.\n",
      "Ross The volcano?\n",
      "Joey Yeah. And speaking of volcanoes, man are they a violent igneous rock formation.\n",
      "Rachel What?!\n",
      "Joey Oh yeah, lava spewing, hot ash, of course some are dormant.\n",
      "Monica Why are you talking about volcanoes all of the sudden?\n",
      "Joey Well, we can talk about something else. What do you want to talk about? Vivisection? The Vasdeferens? The Vietnam War?\n",
      "Monica Oh! Did anybody see that-that documentary on the Korean War? (Joey is pissed)\n",
      "All Oh, yeah. Yeah.\n",
      "Phoebe Oh God, Korea is such a beautiful country.\n",
      "Ross With such a sad history.\n",
      "Chandler Could there be more Kims?\n",
      "Joanna (from her office) Who’s out there?\n",
      "Rachel It’s me! Good morning!\n",
      "Joanna Rachel, could you come in here for a moment, please?\n",
      "Rachel Yeah, sure. Umm, they didn’t have poppy seed bagels, so I… (Enters Joanna’s office and sees her handcuffed to her chair wearing nothing but a slip) Oh my word!\n",
      "Joanna I seem to have had a slight office mishap. Could you please get the key off the back of the door for me.\n",
      "Rachel Oh, yeah! Yeah!\n",
      "Joanna You tell your friend Chandler that we’re definately broken up this time.\n",
      "Rachel Okay.\n",

      "Kathy No, you’re my first. Put the money on the table.\n",

      "Phoebe Oh, hey, Mon, do you still have your like old blouses and dresses from high school?\n",
      "Monica Yeah, I think I have some around here somewhere. Why?\n",
      "Phoebe Well, it’s just that maternity clothes are so expensive.\n",
      "Monica Hey, Rach! I made a pile of your stuff over on this side of the room. If you could just…(Rachel grunts and throws her purse at it)…throw your purses at it.\n",
      "Rachel Bloomingdale’s eliminated my department. (Phoebe gasps)\n",
      "Monica Oh my God, are you out of a job?\n",
      "Rachel No, but they stuck me in personal shopping. Which is just a huge step down!\n",
      "Phoebe Personal shopping? What is that? Like where you walk around with snooty rich people and tell them what to buy?\n",

      "Phoebe That’s a good idea for a business!\n",
      "Chandler I’m totally screwed. Okay, they are gonna be hot and heavy on stage every night, and then they’re gonna go to their cast parties and he’s gonna try to undermine me. Y'know it’ll be like, \"So where’s your boyfriend, what’s-his-name, Chester?\" And she’ll go, \"No-no-no, it’s Chandler.\" And he’ll go, \"Whatever. Ha-ha-ha-ha!\"\n",

      "Joey Chandler, look they’re actors. They’re there to do a job, just ‘cause they work together, doesn’t mean they’re gonna get together. I mean just ‘cause it happened with Susan Sarandon and Tim Robbins, it doesn’t mean it’s gonna happen with them.\n",
      "Ross Oh-oh, Alec Baldwin and Kim Basinger.\n",

      "Ross They’re not a couple!\n",
      "Phoebe Oh-okay, I get the game now.\n",
      "Joey Okay look, look, let me ask you a question, when they were doing it on stage, was it like really hot?\n",
      "Ross Oh yeah!\n",
      "Joey Well okay, so then you’re fine. The rule is when two actors are actually doing it off-stage all the sexual tension between them is gone. Okay? So as long as it’s hot onstage you got nothing to worry about. It’s when the heat goes away, that’s when you’re in trouble.\n",
      "Chandler Really?\n",
      "Joey Look, you guys have been to every play I’ve ever been in, have I ever had chemistry on stage?\n",

      "Chandler Yeah, I know but…\n",

      "Monica (entering) Hey!\n",
      "Joey Hey Mon! Want some pancakes?\n",

      "Joey Yep! Grab a plate.\n",

      "Joey No-no, stay right there. (Monica stops and Joey flips her a pancake, which flies over her head and lands in the living room.) Gettin’ closer.\n",
      "Chandler Okay, okay, but don’t worry, because we also have cereals, muffins, waffles, and, jams, jellies, and marmalades. Which I’m fairly certain are the same thing.\n",
      "Joey Listen also we’re uh, we’re watching the game here Saturday night, if people want to come over.\n",

      "Joshua Well, I need a whole new wardrobe. My wife, well my ex-wife…\n",
      "Rachel Oh, I’m so sorry.\n",
      "Joshua Anyway, she burned all of my clothes. I got away with two things. This suit and what turned out to be a skirt.\n",
      "Rachel Well, at least that’s a great suit.\n",
      "Joshua Yeah, but it wasn’t much fun dropping it off at the dry cleaners in the skirt. (Rachel laughs) So I need everything down to underwear, so if you’re willing, I’m all yours.\n",
      "Rachel Okay.\n",
      "Mr. Waltham Rachel, you needed to speak to me?\n",
      "Rachel No-no, that wasn’t me! (To Joshua) Well, we should get started. Let me show you my underwear. (Joshua turns at that) The selection of underwear we carry.\n",
      "Rachel Oh-oh, sorry, it’s this way, it’s this way. (Motions to the correct way.)\n",
      "Joshua It’s this way? Sorry. (He walks past her and she again admires his butt.)\n",
      "Chandler I’m right! Right? There was like no chemistry between them. Before they had heat, and now there’s no heat! Now you know what this means, Joey told us what this means!\n",
      "Ross All right, let’s not jump to any conclusions. All right? There was some sexual chemistry between them.\n",
      "Chandler Come on, it was like cousins having sex up there!\n",
      "Ross Here she comes. Don’t say a word, okay? Just be cool, don’t be…y'know you.\n",
      "Kathy Hey you guys!\n",
      "Ross Hey!\n",
      "Kathy Hi! (Kisses Chandler) Thank you so much for coming again. Did you like it tonight?\n",

      "Kathy Wasn’t Nick funny when he couldn’t get his match lit?\n",
      "Kathy It’s a good play, isn’t it?\n",
      "Chandler Oh, I loved the play. You were great, and Nick ditto. Clearly you’re having sex with him.\n",
      "Ross Okay, I… (Walks away.)\n",
      "Kathy Clearly, I’m having sex with him?\n",
      "Chandler Oh come on, it was so obvious! There was no chemistry between you two!\n",
      "Kathy Okay, so let me just get this straight. You’re accusing me of cheating on you, and insulting my performance?\n",
      "Chandler Y’know, I-I could see how this could happen, y'know you’re up there every night, you’re naked, touching, kissing.\n",
      "Kathy Acting! Chandler, this is my job! I’m-I’m playing a part in a play! How can you not trust me?!\n",
      "Chandler Well, you can understand, given how we started.\n",
      "Kathy Oh, wow. I can’t believe you’re throwing that in my face.\n",
      "Chandler Well, that is what happened, and I don’t even see you denying this!\n",
      "Kathy I’ll tell you what, Chandler, why don’t you call me when you grow up!\n",
      "Chandler Yeah, well, don’t expect that to happen anytime soon!\n",
      "Rachel I have the best job in the entire world! The most adorable guy came over today, and I got to dress him up all day!\n",
      "Phoebe Rachel has a new doll.\n",
      "Rachel Oh, I wish he was a doll, then I could get a Rachel doll and bump them together and make kissy noises. Oh! And he has the most beautiful name, I never realised it, Joshua! Josh-u-a! Joshua! Josh.\n",
      "Ross Uh, hello!\n",
      "Rachel Hi-e!!\n",

      "Phoebe What? What?\n",
      "Rachel Well, it was just something Josh said about v-necks, but you had to be there.\n",
      "Ross Yeah, how does Jason look in a v-neck?\n",
      "Rachel It’s Joshua.\n",

      "Phoebe (getting up) Well, I hate to eat and run, but…\n",
      "Monica No, wait, please don’t go! I’ve got porn for you too!\n",
      "Phoebe Yeah, I don’t need it.\n",
      "Monica People are supposed to wanna hang out here!\n",
      "Rachel Why? Honey, what is the big deal?\n",
      "Monica I’m the hostess! Not those guys! I’m always the hostess! I mean, I was always the hostess, I mean even when I was little, I mean the girls brought their dollies to my tea party, I-I served the best air.\n",
      "Phoebe Well, why did you make like a whole big thing out of y'know, everyone has to hang out in the big apartment?\n",
      "Monica ‘Cause they took our apartment, I wanted to punish them. But I’m-I’m done now. They’ve suffered enough.\n",
      "Phoebe If you wanted to punish them, you should’ve just made them hang out here!\n",
      "Rachel Yeah, that’s true.\n",
      "Monica All right then, when I’m done with this place, it’s gonna be ten times better than that place!\n",
      "Phoebe Oh, are we gonna trash that place?\n",
      "Chandler Steps! (He opens the door to his apartment to Ross and Joey looking at the new Playboy) Slut! (Ross and Joey quickly hide the Playboy behind their backs. Chandler wonders into the girl’s apartment.) You will all be very happy to hear that Kathy is sleeping with that guy!\n",
      "All What?!\n",
      "Ross So you were right?\n",
      "Chandler I confronted her, and she didn’t deny it! (Pause) I don’t live here! (Goes back into his apartment and they all follow him.)\n",
      "Ross Chandler!\n",
      "Rachel Chandler, what did she say?\n",
      "Phoebe Wait a minute.\n",
      "Joey Come here.\n",
      "Monica Are you sure?\n",
      "Chandler Well, I may be drunk, but I know what she said! Then I went over to Beefsteak Julie’s…\n",
      "Rachel Beefsteak Charlie’s?\n",
      "Chandler Yes! See you and I have always been like—(motions that they think the same.)\n",
      "Rachel Whoops. (Starts to go into Chandler and Joey’s.) Oh, hey, do you need help with that?\n",
      "Monica Nah, I got it.\n",
      "Rachel Ooh, I just feel bad, I never vacuum. (She goes into Chandler and Joey’s.)\n",
      "Rachel Hi!\n",
      "All Hey!\n",
      "Rachel So I was with Joshua for an hour today, and he has not asked me out. It’s just so frustrating!\n",
      "Phoebe Why don’t you ask him out?\n",
      "Joey Oh, yeah, totally! That’s such a turn-on!\n",
      "Rachel Really? It doesn’t seem desperate?\n",
      "Joey Oh-ooh, that’s the turn-on.\n",
      "Phoebe He just got a divorce right?\n",
      "Rachel Hmm-mmm.\n",
      "Phoebe So he’s probably really nervous around women, y'know? Maybe, you just have to make the first move.\n",
      "Rachel Yeah but, I’ve never asked a guy out before.\n",
      "Phoebe (shocked) You’ve never asked a guy out?!!\n",
      "Rachel No. Have you?\n",
      "Phoebe Thousands of times!! That doesn’t make me sound too good does it?\n",
      "Rachel I don’t even know how I would go about it.\n",
      "Joey Oh-oh-oh-oh, how I do it is, I look a woman up and down and say, \"Hey, how you doin’?\"\n",
      "Phoebe Oh, please!\n",
      "Joey (to Phoebe) Hey, how you doin’?\n",
      "Rachel You know what, I’m gonna do that, I’m gonna call him up, and I’m gonna ask him out. I can do that. Ask him out. (Practising) How you doin’? (Calls him) Hi! Joshua? It’s Rachel Green from Bloomingdale’s. (Listens) Yeah, umm, I was wondering if you umm, if you umm, left your wallet at the store today? Well, we found a wallet, and we—(Listens) the license? Well, that is a good idea! Uh, well, let’s see here this says this license belongs to a uh, uh, belongs to a mister uh, Pheebs, and umm, yeah, so sorry to bother you at home. I’ll see you tomorrow. Bye. (Hangs up) (to Phoebe) You’ve done that a thousand times?\n",
      "Phoebe I’ve never done that.\n",
      "Rachel Ohh, God, I just got so nervous that he would say no.\n",
      "Joey Well, you gotta give him something that he can’t say no too. Like uh, Knicks tickets! Invite the guy to a Knicks game, you’re guaranteed he’ll say yes!\n",
      "Rachel Really?! You think that will work?\n",
      "Joey Absolutely! And if it doesn’t, can I get the extra ticket?\n",
      "Joey What the heck is that?\n",
      "Chandler Did she call?\n",
      "Phoebe No, sorry.\n",
      "Chandler All right, maybe I should call her.\n",
      "Joey No! Forget her, man! You don’t need her, you don’t need that!\n",
      "Ross He’s right, what she did was unforgivable.\n",
      "Chandler Well, yeah, but y'know, what-what if I was wrong?\n",
      "Ross How might you be wrong?\n",
      "Chandler Well y'know, what if she didn’t actually sleep with the guy?\n",
      "Joey Dude, tell me she actually told you this.\n",
      "Chandler She did not have to tell me, I saw the play, and there was no heat. Back me up here, Ross!\n",
      "Ross That’s all you’re basing this on?\n",
      "Chandler That’s not backing me up! Look, you said with the off-stage and the heat, and the onstage and the oy heat.\n",
      "Joey Whoa-whoa, that-that was just a theory! There’s a lot of theories that didn’t pan out. The lone gunman. Communism. Geometry.\n",
      "Chandler Oh my God!!\n",
      "Rachel Would you like to go to a basketball game with me? (Tries again.) You know, its funny, basketball, because I happen to have tickets too… (Tries again.) Umm, who likes the Knicks—(Joshua comes in from the dressing room.)\n",
      "Joshua What do you think?\n",
      "Rachel Oh! Well, as a single woman, who is available, I think you look great!\n",
      "Joshua Huh. (She starts brushing the lint off and checking him out in the mirror.) Yeah?\n",
      "Rachel Yep. Oh, yeah, look you great. (She puts her arm in his and checks how they would look as a couple.) Oh yeah. Yeah, this looks great. (Pause) Umm, so you like it?\n",
      "Joshua I do. I do. I love it. In fact, I think I’m gonna wear it home.\n",
      "Rachel Great.\n",
      "Joshua All right, thank you so much for all your help.\n",
      "Rachel Sure.\n",
      "Joshua Well, I guess this is uh, I guess this is it.\n",
      "Rachel Yeah-eah-ha!\n",
      "Joshua Thanks. (He starts to leave) Maybe I’ll see in the spring, with the uh, y’know, for the uh, bathing suits.\n",
      "Rachel Oh well, you don’t want to do that now?!\n",
      "Joshua Ah, that’s okay, thanks.\n",
      "Rachel Okay.\n",
      "Joshua Anyway, hopefully, I’ll see you around sometime. (He goes out the door.)\n",
      "Rachel Basketball!\n",
      "Joshua (coming back in) I’m sorry.\n",
      "Rachel I uh, I have two tickets to the Knicks game tonight if you’re interested, just as a thank you for this week.\n",
      "Joshua Wow! That would be great.\n",
      "Rachel Really?\n",
      "Joshua Yeah, that would be fantastic! My-my nephew is crazy about the Knicks! This is fantastic, thank you so much Rachel. (He takes the tickets and leaves as Mr. Waltham returns.)\n",
      "Mr. Waltham Good morning.\n",
      "Joshua Hi!\n",
      "Kathy (opening the door) Hey.\n",
      "Chandler Hey. I just, I just wanted to come over to-to say that I’m sorry. Y’know? I know I acted like the biggest idiot in the world, and I can completely understand why you were so upset.\n",
      "Kathy Oh wow. I really wish you’d call me.\n",
      "Chandler Yeah, I know, I-I wish I had too, but y’know I-I think this is a good thing. Y'know? ‘Cause we’ve had our first fight, and now we can move on. Y’know, I know for me—(Notices a pair of men’s pants on the chair.) Nick’s pants?\n",
      "Kathy Yeah.\n",
      "Chandler Yeah. Well, I think our second fight is going to be a big one!\n",
      "Joey Okay, for next time, what do you say?\n",
      "Rachel I have an extra ticket. An extra ticket. Not, two tickets, I have an extra ticket.\n",
      "Ross So the first time you ask a guy out, he-he turns you down?\n",
      "Rachel He didn’t turn me down! He’s at the game isn’t he? I got the date, I’m just not on it!\n",
      "Monica (entering) Okay, it’s ready. Come on.\n",
      "Joey What’s ready?\n",
      "Monica Just come.\n",

      "Phoebe Great!\n",
      "Ross This is beautiful!\n",
      "Phoebe Oh did you—what did you—did you work for two days straight?\n",
      "Monica Pretty much. (to Joey) So, what do you, what do you think of the floor?\n",
      "Joey I don’t know, it looks the same.\n",
      "Monica You used to have carpet.\n",
      "Joey Oh yeah!\n",
      "Monica So I made snacks. Please, just hang out okay? I’m just gonna rest my eyes just a little bit.\n",
      "Ross Look, Mon, do you want us to uh, come back later?\n",
      "Monica Oh no-no-no, stay, stay, stay, just keep talking. I’m always the hostess.\n",
      "Ross Hey!\n",
      "Joey How’d it go?\n",
      "Chandler Well, she wasn’t sleeping with him.\n",
      "Phoebe Oh good!\n",
      "Chandler She is now.\n",
      "Ross What are you saying?\n",
      "Chandler I’m saying that she… is a devil woman! Y’know I mean you think you know someone and then they turn around and they sleep with Nick! Nick, with his rock hard pecs, and his giant man-nipples! I hate him, I hate her! Well, I don’t hate her, I love her. This is all my fault really.\n",
      "Phoebe How? How is your fault?\n",
      "Chandler Because, I-I should’ve called! Y’know if I had just called her after our big, stupid fight, she never would’ve gone out with Nick, and they would’ve ended up in bed together. I threw her at his man nipples!\n",
      "Rachel Honey, this is not your fault, just because you guys had a fight, it does not justify her sleeping with someone.\n",
      "Ross Well, if-if she thought they were on a break…\n",
      "Mr. Waltham Rachel, one of your customers seems to have left his billfold. A Joshua Bergen.\n",
      "Rachel Really?\n",
      "Mr. Waltham Will you call him?\n",
      "Rachel Yes! I will! Absolutely! (She takes out his license and her license and holds them face to face with each other. She then proceeds to act like Dark Helmut in Spaceballs, and mimic a conversation between the two of them.) Hello, Rachel. Hi, Joshua. I left my wallet here on purpose. Really? Yes, I just wanted to see you again. Oh, I’m glad. Rachel, I’d like to say something to you. Yes? How you doin’?\n",

      "Monica No! (pushes him) No!\n",
      "Richard Okay.\n",
      "Monica ‘Cause if you do that means you’d be cancelling it for me, and we’re just friends.\n",
      "Richard Exactly. (pushes her back)\n",
      "Robert Hey.\n",
      "Phoebe Hey. Ooh! Don’t sit down!\n",
      "Robert You ready to go to the batting cage?\n",
      "Phoebe Yeah. And, first here’s a gift.\n",
      "Robert Oh! Wow! Hey!\n",
      "Chandler Stretchy pants! Why, those are the greatest things in the world! If I were you I would wear them every day, every day!\n",
      "Robert Jeez, thank you really that is so nice. But um, to be honest, I don’t think I can wear these, they’re so tight, I feel like I’m on display. I’m sorry.\n",
      "Phoebe That’s all right, that’s well, I figured.... (they start to leave as Joey enters.)\n",
      "Robert (to Joey) Hey!\n",
      "Joey Hey! (starts to laugh.) How’s it going?\n",
      "Ross Good.\n",
      "Joey Hey, Rach, how you doing with The Shining?\n",
      "Rachel Oh, Danny just went into room 217.\n",
      "Joey Oooh, the next part’s the best, when that dead lady in the bathtub...\n",
      "Rachel Oh, no, meh-nah-nah-nah, come on you’re gonna ruin it!\n",
      "Joey All right I’ll talk in code. (to Ross and Chandler) Remember when the kid sees those two blanks in the hallway?\n",
      "Chandler Hmmm, that’s very cool.\n",
      "Joey Oh, all blank, and no blank, make’s blank a blank blank. Oh no-no-no, no, the end when Jack almost kills them all with that blank, but then at last second they get away. Aww!\n",
      "Rachel Joey! I can’t believe you just did that!\n",
      "Chandler I can’t believe she cracked your code!\n",
      "Rachel All right, okay, Laurie proposes to Jo, and she says no, even though she’s still in love with him, and then he ends up marring Amy.\n",
      "Joey Hey! Mine was by accident! All right, the boiler explodes and destroys the hotel, and kills the dad.\n",
      "Rachel Eh. Beth dies.\n",
      "Joey Beth, Beth dies?\n",
      "Rachel Um-hmm.\n",
      "Joey Is that true? If I keep reading is Beth gonna die?\n",
      "Chandler No, Beth doesn’t die, she doesn’t die. Does she Rachel?\n",
      "Rachel What?!\n",
      "Ross Joey’s asking if you’ve just ruined the first book he’s ever loved that didn’t star Jack Nicholson?\n",
      "Rachel No. She doesn’t die.\n",
      "Joey Then why would you say that?!\n",
      "Rachel Because, I wanted to hurt you.\n",
      "Robert (running in) Oh, there they are! I-I dropped my keys.\n",
      "Rachel (gasps) Oh my....\n",
      "Robert Got ‘em.\n",
      "Monica Hi.\n",
      "Rachel (screams and grabs a potato masher to defend herself) Sorry. I’m sorry.\n",
      "Monica You would not believe my day! I had to work two shifts, and then to top it off, I lost one of my fake boobs, (opens her coat revealing a large burn mark over her left breast.) in a grill fire.\n",
      "Monica What are you smiling at?\n",
      "Rachel I’m sorry, I was just thinking you’re day could still pick up.\n",
      "Monica Yeah, right.\n",
      "Richard Hello.\n",
      "Monica I love this friend thing!\n",
      "Phoebe Listen, Robert’s gonna be here any second so, will one of you just tell him?\n",
      "Ross Oh.\n",
      "Phoebe Please, right now, no, every time I see him it’s like ‘Is it on the lose?’ ‘Is it watching me?’\n",
      "Chandler We can’t tell him, you can’t go up to a guy you barely know and talk about his.... stuff.\n",
      "Ross He’s right, even if it’s to say something complementary. (He stops and thinks about what he just said.)\n",
      "Robert (entering) Hey!\n",
      "Phoebe Hey.\n",
      "Robert (to Phoebe) So are ready for the gym? They’ve got this new rock climbing wall, we can spot each other.\n",
      "Phoebe No, I can spot you from here.\n",
      "Robert What?\n",
      "Phoebe Okay, listen Robert...\n",
      "Ross (to Chandler) Hey, don’t we have to...\n",
      "Chandler Yeah, we got, um-hmm.\n",
      "Phoebe Umm, I think you’re really, really great...\n",
      "Robert Oh God! Here we go again. Why does this keep happening to me? (spreads his legs) Is it something I’m putting out there? Is this my fault? Or am I just nuts?\n",
      "Phoebe I-I-I-I-I don’t know, I don’t know what to say.\n",
      "Gunther (cleaning up the table) (to Robert) Hey buddy, this is a family place, put the mouse back in the house.\n",
      "Monica Ow!\n",
      "Richard (outside the bedroom) Really?! Well, it’s just like everyone else’s apartment. It’s got rooms, walls, and ceilings.\n",
      "Richard’s Date Well, I just wanted to see where you lived. Now, give me the tour.\n",
      "Monica Oh my God! Oh my God! (She frantically tries to clean up the bedroom as Richard starts the tour.)\n",
      "Richard Ah well, this is the living room.\n",
      "Richard’s Date Impressive.\n",
      "Richard All right. This is the kitchen.\n",
      "Richard’s Date Oh, that’s real pretty. Wait a minute, don’t I get to see the bedroom?\n",
      "Richard The bedroom. Well it’s pretty much your typical... (opens the door as Monica hides under the covers, and quickly closes the door before his date can see the room.) bedroom.\n",
      "Richard’s Date We’re still on this side of the door.\n",
      "Richard Um-hmm.\n",
      "Richard’s Date Yeah, but I didn’t get to see it.\n",
      "Richard Oh shoot! Maybe next time. (yawns) Thanks for a lovely evening. (shows her out)\n",
      "Monica (still hiding under the blankets) So um, who was she?\n",
      "Richard Oh, (laughs) that was the blind date that I told you about, she called and switched it to today.\n",
      "Monica (still hiding under the blankets) Did you like her? And I’m just asking as a friend, because I am totally fine with this.\n",
      "Richard Well, you seem fine.\n",
      "Monica (gets up) Okay, y'know what, I’m not fine, I’m not. I mean how can I be fine, hearing you come in with her, she wants to see your bedroom.... (pause) Y'know what, what if we’re friends who don’t see other people?\n",
      "Richard You mean like exclusive friends?\n",
      "Monica Why not?! I mean this has been the most amazing week. Would it be so terrible? Even if we were friends who lived together. Or, maybe someday friends who stood up in front of their other friends, and vowed to be friends forever.\n",
      "Richard Wow. Y'know we’re back where we were. Honey, I would love to do all that, but nothing’s changed.\n",
      "Monica That’s not true, you don’t have a moustache.\n",
      "Richard Okay, okay, one thing’s changed. But we still want different things and we know how this is gonna end.\n",
      "Monica Y'know what, I’ve got to walk out of here right now, ‘cause getting over you is the hardest thing that I have ever had to do. I don’t think I could do it again.\n",
      "Richard I know I couldn’t. So....\n",
      "Monica How ‘bout one last game of racquetball?\n",
      "Monica Watch the thorns!\n",
      "Richard (lying down) Ow!!\n",
      "Rachel What?\n",
      "Joey Beth is really, really sick.\n",
      "Rachel Awwww.\n",
      "Joey Jo’s there, but I don’t think there’s anything she could do.\n",
      "Rachel Joey?\n",
      "Joey Yeah.\n",
      "Rachel Do you want to put the book in the freezer?\n",

      "Monica Hey, look at me. I'm making jam, been at it since 4 o'clock this morning.\n",
      "Ross Where'd you get fruit at four in the morning?\n",
      "Monica Went down to the docks. Bet ya didn't know you could get it wholesale.\n",

      "Chandler Hey.\n",
      "Ross Aww, is it broken?\n",
      "Joey No, I gotta wear this thing for a couple weeks. (points to the sling he is wearing)\n",
      "Rachel Did you tell the doctor you did it jumping up and down on your bed?\n",
      "Joey Nooo. I had a story all worked out but then Chandler sold me out.\n",
      "Chandler Well, I'm sorry Joe. I didn't think the doctor was gonna buy that it just *fell* out of the socket.\n",
      "Joey What is this? Fruit?\n",
      "Rachel Monica's making jam.\n",
      "Joey Whoa, jam! I love jam! (to Chandler) Hey, how come we never have jam at our place?\n",
      "Chandler Because the kids need new shoes.\n",
      "Monica I'm going into business people. I'm sick and tired of being depressed about Richard. I needed a plan, a plan to get over my man. What's the opposite of man? Jam. (sees Joey trying some jam from the pot) Oh Joey don't! It's way to hot. (Joey realizes this and spits what he had in his mouth back into the pot.)\n",
      "Joey This will just be my batch.\n",
      "Phoebe (turns around) Um, that's it. No. Hey! You! J. Crew guy. Yeah. Why have you been following me? I mean, all week long everywhere I look there's you.\n",
      "Guy You wouldn't return my calls, you sent back my letters....\n",
      "Phoebe What?\n",
      "Guy One more chance Ursula, please?\n",
      "Phoebe Oooh. Oh, well this is awkward.\n",
      "Guy Wh..\n",
      "Phoebe Um, yeah, you want Ursula, and I'm Phoebe. Twin sisters! Seriously.\n",
      "Guy Oh, that's great. I'm stalking the wrong woman. I am such a dingus!\n",
      "Phoebe Oh, you're not a dingus.\n",
      "Guy I just, I want you to know I didn't used to be like this. Before I meet your sister I was like this normal guy who sold beepers and cellular phones.\n",
      "Phoebe Well, I mean look it's, it's not your fault, you know. I mean this is just what, what she does to guys, okay.\n",
      "Guy Well thanks. (starts to leave)\n",
      "Phoebe Wait, (grabs him) you know what, I got a little story. When I was in Junior High School I went through this period where I thought I was a witch. And there was this guidance counselor who said something to me, that I think will help you a lot. He said okay, 'you're not a witch you're just an average student.' See what I'm saying?\n",
      "Guy Not really.\n",
      "Phoebe Um, well, get over it. So, I mean you, you just seem to be a really nice guy, you know. Don't be so hard on yourself okay.\n",
      "Guy Wait. You're right. I know you're right. And, thanks for being so nice. Here (gives her the flowers he bought.)\n",
      "Phoebe Oh, thanks a lot. Do you want to get a cup of coffee?\n",
      "Guy Yeah, okay.\n",

      "Rachel Oooh.\n",

      "Rachel Oh, oh, that's what you're talking about. (to Chandler) Hey.\n",
      "Ross Hey.\n",
      "Chandler Do I look fat?\n",
      "Ross and Rachel Noo.\n",
      "Chandler Okay, I accept that. When Janice asked me and I said no, she took that to mean that I was calling her a cow.\n",
      "Rachel Okay, walk us through it, honey, walk us through it.\n",
      "Chandler Okay, well. Janice said 'Hi, do I look fat today?' And I, I looked at her....\n",
      "Ross Whoa, whoa, whoa. You looked at her. You never look. You just answer, it's just a reflex. Do I look fat? Nooo! Is she prettier than I am? Noo! Does size matter?\n",
      "Rachel Nooo!\n",
      "Ross And it works both ways.\n",
      "Chandler Okay, so you both just know this stuff?\n",
      "Rachel Well you know, after about thirty or forty fights, you kinda catch on.\n",
      "Ross Okay, for instance. Let's say, Janice is coming back from a trip and she gives you two options. Option number 1 she'll take a cab home from the airport. Option 2 is you can meet her at baggage claim. Which do you do?\n",
      "Chandler That's easy, baggage claim.\n",
      "Ross (buzzes) Wrong! Now you're single. It's actually secret option number three, you meet her at the gate. That way she knows you love her.\n",
      "Chandler Okay, this is good, this is good. All right listen, I have one. Janice likes to cuddle, at night, which, you know I'm all for. But, uh, you know when you want to go to sleep, you want some space. So, uh, how do I tell her that without, you know, accidentally calling her fat or something.\n",
      "Rachel Oh honey, I'm sorry we can't help you there, 'cause we're cuddlily sleepers. (Chandler makes an 'Ewww' face) Okay, I'm late for work.\n",
      "Ross Oh.\n",
      "Rachel All right are you guys gonna come down?\n",
      "Ross Uh, yeah, yeah I'll, I'm right behind you.\n",
      "Rachel Good luck Chandler.\n",
      "Chandler Thank you Rachel.\n",
      "Ross Bye sweetie.\n",
      "Rachel Bye hon.\n",
      "Ross (blows her a kiss) Okay the sleeping thing. Very tricky business, but there is something you can do.\n",
      "Chandler Well, I thought you guys were cuddlily sleepers.\n",
      "Ross Noo! No, not cuddlily, not me, just her. I'm like you, I need the room. Okay, come here. (they sit on the couch and Ross puts his hands on Chandler's shoulder and thigh.) Okay, you're in bed...\n",
      "Chandler Yeah. (they both notice where his hands are)\n",
      "Ross I'm gonna use the cushion.\n",
      "Chandler Yeah.\n",
      "Ross Okay, you're in bed. She's over on your side, cuddling. Now you wait for her to drift off, and then you hug her (demonstrates on the cushion) and roll her back over to her side of the bed. And then you rollll a-way. Hug for her! Roll for you.\n",
      "Chandler Okay, the old hug and roll.\n",
      "Ross Yep.\n",
      "Chandler Okay, one question.\n",
      "Ross Shoot.\n",
      "Chandler You're pretending the pillow's a girl right?\n",
      "Joey Remember when you where a kid and your Mom would drop you off at the movies with a jar of jam and a little spoon?\n",
      "Rachel (Looks at him) You're so pretty.\n",
      "Phoebe (entering) Hi!\n",
      "All Hey, Phoebe.\n",
      "Phoebe Hey, oh, you know that guy who's been following me? I talked to him today.\n",
      "Joey (with food in his mouth) You talked to him. Are you crazy?\n",
      "Phoebe Okay, first I'm not crazy. And second, say it don't spray it. Anyway his name is Malcom, and he wasn't following me, I mean he was, but 'cause he thought I was Ursula, ick. And, that's why, that's why he couldn't just come up and talk to me. 'Cause of the restraining order.\n",
      "Chandler Umm, not feeling better 'bout Malcom.\n",
      "Phoebe Ooh! No, no, no, no, he's not like a kook, no. He's just like this, this very passionate, incredibly romantic guy, that got like a tinsy bit carried away, you know. And we just get along really well, and he's so cute.\n",
      "Ross Oh my God, you've got a crush on your sister's stalker.\n",
      "Phoebe No, I'm just gonna help him, you know, get 'de-Ursula-ized', like you know, like I did for Joey after he went out with her.\n",
      "Joey (with his mouthful) Hey, I didn't stalk her. I mean (he sprays Phoebe with crumbs)\n",
      "Phoebe Okay, I asked for the news, not the weather.\n",
      "Monica (entering) Hey guys.\n",
      "All Hey Mon.\n",
      "Monica Joey, this is for you. (gives him a jar of jam) It's blackberry curin.\n",
      "Joey Aww. (tastes it) Ohh!\n",
      "Chandler Hey, Joe, I gotta ask. The girl from the Xerox place buck naked (holds up one hand), or, or a big tub of jam. (holds up the other hand)\n",
      "Joey Put your hands together.\n",
      "Monica Joey, take your time with that. That's my last batch.\n",
      "Joey No more jam?!\n",
      "Rachel Well, what happened to your jam plan?\n",
      "Monica I figured out I need to charge seventeen bucks a jar just to break even. So, I've got a new plan now. Babies.\n",
      "Chandler Well, your gonna need much bigger jars.\n",
      "Ross What are you talking about?\n",
      "Monica I'm talking about me having a baby.\n",
      "Ross What?\n",
      "Rachel Are you serious?\n",
      "Monica Yeah. The great thing about the jam plan was, I was taking control of my life. So I asked myself, what is the most important thing to me in the world and that's when I came up with the baby plan.\n",
      "Ross Well, aren't you forgetin' something? What, what, what is uh, what is that guy's name? Dad!\n",
      "Monica It took me 28 years to find one man that I wanna spend my life with, if I have to wait another 28 years then, I'll be 56 before I can have a baby, and that's just stupid.\n",
      "Chandler That, that's what's stupid.\n",
      "Monica I don't need an actual man, just a couple of his best swimmers. And there, there are places you can go to get that stuff.\n",
      "Rachel Down at the docks again?\n",
      "Janice Night-night Bing-a-ling.\n",
      "Chandler Night-night.....Janice. (he starts thinking to him self) 'Look at all that room on her side, you good fit a giant penguin over there. That would be weird though. Okay, hug and roll time. I'm huggin', I'm huggin', your rollin', and....yes! Freedom! (his one arm is still under her) Except for this arm! I'm stuck. Stuck arm! Okay, time for the old table cloth trick, one fluid motion. Quick like a cat, quick like a cat! And 1...2...3!' (Pulls his arm out from under her and she is spun off of the bed.)\n",
      "Malcom Here's my binoculars.\n",
      "Phoebe Oh, great. Great. You're doing great, you know real strong. Going strong. Keep going.\n",
      "Malcom These are my night vision goggles. This is the book I pretend to read when I'm watching her in the park. And these are Mad Lips, they're just for fun.\n",
      "Phoebe Oh, yeah. What's this? (picks up a book)\n",
      "Malcom Oh, this is log I kept, recording her every movement. Do you wanna here something from it?\n",
      "Phoebe Um, not even a little bit.\n",
      "Malcom It's about you.\n",
      "Phoebe Oh, okay then.\n",
      "Malcom (reading) I met Phoebe today. She was really nice to me eventhough I'm such a loser. And, then when I was walking home I thought about her a lot, it was weird, but kinda cool.\n",
      "Phoebe Good. So what were you thinking?\n",
      "Malcom I was thinking what it would be like to kiss you.\n",
      "Phoebe Really?\n",
      "Malcom No.\n",
      "Phoebe Oh.\n",
      "Malcom See that's just something I said now, so that maybe I could kiss you.\n",
      "Phoebe Oh, okay. (he kisses her)\n",
      "Chandler No, that's all right. I just had a jar of mustard.\n",

      "Monica You're gonna what?\n",
      "Ross I'm gonna tell Mom.\n",
      "Rachel Honey, I'm sorry, but he's right. I love you, but you're crazy.\n",
      "Ross Crazy.\n",
      "Monica What?! Why? Why is this crazy? So this isn't the ideal way to something....\n",
      "Ross (interrupting her) Oh, it's not the ideal way...\n",
      "Monica Lips moving, still talking. I mean it may not be ideal, but I'm so ready. No, I-I-I see the way Ben looks at you. It makes me ache, you know?\n",
      "Joey Check it out!! Jam crackers!\n",
      "Monica Okay, all right, how's this? 27. Italian-American guy. He's an actor, born in Queens. Wow, big family, seven sisters, and he's the only....boy. (they all turn and look at Joey) Oh my God, under personal comments: 'New York Knicks, rule!'\n",

      "Rachel When did you go to a sperm bank?\n",
      "Joey Well, right after I did that sex study down at NYU. (to Chandler) Hey, Remember that sweater I gave you for your birthday?\n",
      "Chandler And that's how you bought it?\n",
      "Joey Noooo, that's what I was wearing when I donated. I'm kinda surprised there's any of my boys left.\n",
      "Monica Well, honey, it is pretty competitive. I mean I've got an actual rocket scientist here.\n",
      "Joey Maybe, I should call this place and get them to put my 'Days of Our Lives' on here. You know, juice this puppy up a little.\n",
      "Phoebe (entering) Hellooo!\n",
      "All Hey.\n",
      "Ross How's the maniac?\n",
      "Phoebe Oh, well he's yummy. We did a little kissin'.\n",
      "Rachel Phoebe, what are you doing?\n",
      "Phoebe Oh, no, no, no, no. You know what, he's not into that stuff anymore. He quit for me.\n",
      "Rachel Pheebs, this guy has been obsessed with your sister, for God knows how long, okay, you don't just give up something like that.\n",

      "Phoebe Oh, I was just here looking for, um, my um, my part of an old sandwich. Oh, here it is! Oh. (picks one up out of the garbage can.)\n",
      "Malcom Were you following me?\n",
      "Phoebe Um, perhaps. Yes! Yes, I'm sorry, I'm sorry. I was just afraid that you were still hung up on my sister.\n",
      "Malcom So you spied on me. I can't believe you don't trust me. (Ursula walks past, and Malcom finds behind the pillar)\n",
      "Phoebe Oh well, what do you know, there goes my identical twin sister. Just walkin' along looking like me. What, is this just like a freakish coincidence, or did you know she takes this train?\n",
      "Malcom I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I tried to stop, but I couldn't. I'm so pathetic.\n",
      "Phoebe No, no, it's not your fault. You know it's partly my fault, 'cause I made you quit cold turkey. Sorry, no. Okay, well, I mean, I can't date you anymore, 'cause your, you know (in a high pitched voice) Wow! But um, but I will definitely, definitely help you get over my sister. Okay, stalk me for a while. Huh? Yeah, and, and, and, I'll be like an Ursula patch.\n",
      "Malcom Uh-huh, I don't know.\n",
      "Phoebe Yeah, just, okay, look I'm going. Um, come on. Op, op, behind the pillar, which way am I gonna go?\n",
      "Joey Hey.\n",
      "Monica Hey.\n",
      "Joey Where you going?\n",
      "Monica To the bank.\n",
      "Joey Sperm or regular?\n",
      "Monica Sperm.\n",
      "Joey So you're really doing this, huh?\n",
      "Monica Oh yeah, picked a guy, 37135.\n",
      "Joey Sounds nice.\n",
      "Monica 'Fraid so. Brown hair, green eyes...\n",
      "Joey No kiddin', hmm.\n",
      "Monica What?\n",
      "Joey No, I-I figured you would've picked a blond guy.\n",
      "Monica Really? Why?\n",
      "Joey I don't know, I just always pictured you ending up with one of those tall, smart blond guys, name like.... Hoyt.\n",
      "Monica Hoyt?\n",
      "Joey It's a name, yeah. I saw you, you know, in this great house with a big pool.\n",
      "Monica Really, is he a swimmer?\n",
      "Joey He's got the body for it.\n",
      "Monica I like that. (Joey starts laughing) What?\n",
      "Joey You guys have one of those signs that says: 'We don't swim in your toilet, so don't pee in our pool.', you know.\n",
      "Monica We do not have one of those signs.\n",
      "Joey Sure you do, it was a gift from me. Oh! And you have these three great kids.\n",
      "Monica Two girls and a boy?\n",
      "Joey Yeah!\n",
      "Monica And, and, and they wear those little water wings, you know. And they're, they're running around on the deck. Then Hoyt wraps this big towel around all three of them.\n",
      "Joey Sure! (Monica gets very depressed) But hey, you know this way sounds good too.\n",
      "Monica Yeah.\n",
      "Joey Oh Monica. (goes over and hugs her, then looks at the form and stops hugging her.) Wow, this guy's an astronaut. That would've been cool, (sees Monica) for like a day. (hugs her again).\n",
      "Joey I called the sperm bank today, they haven't sold a single unit of Tribianni. Nobody wants my product. I mean, I-I-I don't get it (tries to drink the rest of the jam out of the jar and gets it all over his face, on his chin, nose, etc.) Maybe if they met me in person.\n",
      "Rachel Honey, you got a little thing on your...(points to her whole face)\n",
      "Joey (wipes a little jam from the corner of his mouth) Did I get it?\n",
      "Rachel Yeah.\n",
      "Ross (entering) Hello.\n",
      "Rachel Hello.\n",
      "Ross (sees Joey) Hey. (walks into the living room) Uh, Chan, can I uh, can I talk to you for a second?\n",
      "Chandler Sure. What's up?\n",
      "Ross Just one uh, one additional relationship thought. Probably something your already familiar with, uh, women talk! (smacks Chandler over the head with a magazine)\n",

      "Ross Oh, yeah, no problems. It’s all taken care of.\n",
      "Rachel Ross, thank you. Hey, do you guys wanna go see a movie?\n",
      "Ross Oh yeah, why not?\n",
      "Rachel Okay, umm, I’m gonna get my sweater. (Walks away.)\n",
      "Ross Okay. (Sits down next to Phoebe.) You uh, you wanna hear something weird?\n",
      "Phoebe Always.\n",
      "Ross I didn’t get the annulment.\n",
      "Phoebe What?!\n",
      "Ross We’re still married! Don’t tell Rachel. See you later. (He gets up leaving Phoebe in shock.)\n",
      "Ross (To Rachel) Hey, do you have any gum?\n",
      "Rachel Oh? Yeah! Sure!\n",
      "Phoebe (running out) Wait! Wait! Hi! Listen, Ross can I just talk to you for just a second?\n",
      "Rachel Oh but Phoebe, we’re gonna be late for the movie.\n",
      "Phoebe Oh, there’s a cab! Taxi!! (The cab stops and she opens the door.) Good timing, my God, huh? Here you go. (Pushes Rachel in and closes the door.)\n",
      "Rachel Yeah, we’re, we’re actually just gonna walk ‘cause it’s right up there at the Angelica.\n",
      "Phoebe Oh, the Angelica!! Go! Go! (She bangs on the cab’s roof and it pulls away.) (To Ross) You didn’t get the annulment?!!\n",
      "Ross I know.\n",
      "Phoebe Ross?!\n",
      "Ross Well, I tried! But when I got to my lawyer’s office all I could hear was, \"Three divorces. Three divorces!\" Look, I just don’t want my tombstone to read, Ross Gellar, Three Divorces.\n",
      "Phoebe Don’t be worried about that! Your tombstone can say whatever you want it to say! It could say, Ross Geller, Good at Marriage! Y’know? Mine’s gonna say Phoebe Buffay, Buried Alive.\n",
      "Ross Look, all I know is I-I can’t have another failed marriage!\n",
      "Phoebe So okay what? You’re gonna be married to a girl who doesn’t even know about it?!—Op, woman! Sorry.\n",
      "Ross Well, okay so, I don’t have it all worked out quite yet. Just don’t say anything to Rachel, please?\n",
      "Phoebe Rachel is one of my closest friends. (Pause) Although, being the only one who knows anything about this does makes me feel special. Okay!\n",
      "Rachel (to the driver) Okay, stop-stop! Phoebe?!\n",
      "Phoebe Hey Rach!\n",
      "Rachel What was that?!\n",
      "Phoebe Sorry, mix up. Hey, how was the movie?\n",
      "Rachel I haven’t seen it yet!\n",

      "Chandler Y’know when we move in together, can I get a gumball machine?\n",
      "Monica Of course! Joey wouldn’t let you have one?\n",
      "Chandler No. When it comes to sweets, he’s surprisingly strict.\n",
      "Monica Hey, have you figured out a way to tell him you’re moving out?\n",
      "Chandler No, no, I keep trying, y’know? I can get out, \"Joey, I have too…\" but then I lose my nerve and I always finish with, \"…go to the bathroom.\" He may think I’m sick.\n",
      "Monica Y’know, I really have to tell Rachel, but I… We just have to get it over with! Y’know, the next time we see them we’re just gonna tell them. Okay? That’s it.\n",
      "Chandler Oh, so that’s this is gonna work now? You’re just gonna order me around all the time?\n",

      "Chandler All right.\n",
      "Joey (entering) Hey Monica!\n",
      "Monica Hi!\n",

      "Monica Joey, we have something to tell you.\n",
      "Joey Oh my God! You’re pregnant!\n",
      "Chandler No-o-o! (To Monica) No? (She nods no.) No-o-o! Look Joey, here’s the thing, Monica and I have decided to live together, here. So, I’m gonna be moving out man.\n",
      "Joey Wow! (Tearing up) Well, uh… Hey! I’m really happy for you guys! Congratulations! (Kisses Monica on the cheek) See you later. (Starts for the door on the verge of tears as Monica stops him.)\n",
      "Monica Wait! Joey! Joey! Are you okay?!\n",
      "Joey Yeah, I gotta go! I got an acting job. (Turns towards the door, pauses, and turns back.) Like you’d believe that. This sucks!\n",
      "Chandler Look, I-I’m just gonna be right across the hall and I promise you, the minute Monica and I break up I’m moving right back in with you!\n",
      "Joey (To Monica) Okay! Look-look-look, uh, if you’re gonna be moving in with him I feel it’s my responsibility to tell you the truth about him! Okay? He’s a terrible roommate! Terrible! He uh, forgets to umm… Oh-oh he always, he always umm—Oh, who am I kidding! He’s the best roommate ever! (Hugs Chandler.)\n",
      "Monica Hey Pheebs!\n",
      "Phoebe Hey!\n",
      "Monica Hey, have you seen Rachel?\n",
      "Phoebe No, why?\n",
      "Monica I have some pretty exciting news!\n",
      "Phoebe (gasps) You’re pregnant!\n",
      "Monica No! Chandler and I are moving in together!\n",
      "Phoebe Ooh! That’s good! Wow! But now if you were pregnant, what would you name it? Hint: Phoebe.\n",

      "Ross What’s up?\n",

      "Phoebe Guys, I’m happy too.\n",
      "Monica Okay, come here! (Phoebe joins them in the hug.)\n",
      "Phoebe Wow! Big day huh? People moving in, people getting annulled… (Winks at Ross.)\n",
      "Monica Okay, I gotta go find Rachel but umm, if you guys see her could you please try to give her some really bad news so that mine doesn’t seem so bad? (Exits.)\n",
      "Ross Bye.\n",
      "Phoebe Hmm, something bad to tell Rachel… Bad news for Rachel, what could that be?!\n",
      "Ross Could ya just, could ya just lay off, please? All right? My life is an embarrassment! I should go live under somebody’s stairs!\n",
      "Phoebe Ross, it’s not that big a deal! So you’ll been divorced three times, you’ll still have a life, you’ll go on dates…\n",
      "Ross (interrupting) No! No, I won’t! I’ll be at the bottom of the dating barrel now. The only guys below me will be Four Divorce Guy uh, Murderer Guy, and-and, Geologists.\n",
      "Phoebe Ross, you’re being ridiculous! Okay? You are cute and smart and sweet and that is much more important than three stupid divorces!\n",
      "Ross Oh yeah? Have you ever dated anyone who has been divorced three times?\n",
      "Phoebe Y’know that’s really fair. Y’know? Most guys who have been divorced three times are like 60. Ross, nobody cares about this except you! This-this embarrassment thing is all in your head! Here, I’ll show you! Come here.\n",
      "Ross What?! Why?\n",
      "Phoebe (to the girls) Hi! Hi! Listen, my friend Ross is about to be divorced for the third time, but wouldn’t you date him?\n",
      "Ross And if you wait right here, I’ll go get Ross. (Phoebe grabs his arm and prevents him from escaping.)\n",
      "Chandler (entering) Hey!\n",
      "Monica Ugh, I thought you were Rachel!\n",
      "Chandler (looking down) What gave me away?\n",
      "Monica I just tell her, I have to get it over with. I told Ross and Phoebe and she’s the only one left!\n",
      "Chandler Okay, so that’s it, everybody knows! It’s official, we’re moving in together. No turning back. Are ya scared? Are ya?\n",
      "Monica No.\n",
      "Chandler Wow that was my scariest voice! You’re very brave.\n",
      "Rachel Hey!\n",
      "Chandler Hey.\n",
      "Rachel Ugh, the worse day! Y’know, you think you’re making progress at work and then your boss calls you Raquel.\n",
      "Chandler Hey listen, for the first four years of my work everybody called me Sha-la-lap. (Awkward silence ensues.) Seriously.\n",
      "Rachel I believe you. So, it was right in the middle of a staff meeting so of course no one else wants to correct her so everyone else is calling me Raquel! By the end of the day, the mailroom guys were calling me Rocky!\n",
      "Chandler Well, I-I still think you’re very-very nice and very pretty…\n",
      "Rachel What?\n",
      "Chandler (To Monica) All yours babe. (Walks away.)\n",
      "Monica Have a seat. (They sit at the table.) Okay, listen umm, Chandler and I are going to live together, here.\n",
      "Rachel Oh my God! That’s so great! I’m so happy for you guys!\n",
      "Monica Really?!\n",
      "Rachel And that was so sweet of you to ask! Oh my God, the three of us are gonna have such a good time living together!\n",
      "Monica Yes, we are. (Chandler is frantically trying to get Monica to correct her.)\n",
      "Rachel And Chandler, you’re gonna have to watch those long showers you take in the morning because you know Raquel can’t be late.\n",
      "Chandler Rach…\n",
      "Monica Yeah, he’s gonna work on that.\n",
      "Rachel Ohh! This is so exciting! Oh God… (Gasps and starts to sing) Come and knock on my door…\n",
      "Monica (singing) We’ll be waiting for you…\n",
      "Ross …once you know the stories, it’s not that bad. First marriage, wife’s hidden sexuality, not my fault. Second marriage, said the wrong name at the altar, a little my fault. Third marriage, well they really shouldn’t allow you to get married when you’re that drunk and have writing all over your face, Nevada’s fault.\n",
      "Phoebe Okay, so what do you think ladies? Who wouldn’t be interested? Who wouldn’t want to date him?\n",
      "Stephanie Well the divorces don’t bother me, I’d date him. But, not while he’s still married.\n",
      "Phoebe Okay, what about you? (Points to Karin) Wouldn’t you want a date?\n",
      "Karin Actually, I’m dating at all anymore. See, I figured out that I was only dating guys that were like y’know bad for me, so until I work that out…\n",
      "Phoebe (interrupting) Whatever! What about you Meg?\n",
      "Meg Well, I don’t care about the divorces either, but I wouldn’t date him. It’s just that he’s obviously still in love with this Rachel girl.\n",
      "Ross What?!\n",
      "Phoebe (leaning to him) She said, \"He’s obviously still in love with this Rachel girl.\" (He glares at her.)\n",
      "Ross This is crazy! I mean, yes-yes Rachel is my good friend and I-I have loved her in the past, but now, she is just my wife! Phoebe, will you-will you help me out here?\n",
      "Phoebe Well, I thought you loved her when you-when you married her.\n",
      "Ross We were drunk! I would’ve married uh, Joey with that amount of alcohol!\n",
      "Phoebe Hey! You could do a lot worse than Joey Tribbiani!!\n",
      "Ross (to the panel) Look, I’m sorry, but you guys are wrong. I just don’t want to be divorced three times.\n",
      "Phoebe Yes, and now he’s using this three divorces reason because he wants to stay married to her because he loves her. I must say, \"Well done!\" Bravo Meg.\n",
      "Ross (getting up) Okay! Fine! Fine! If-if this is what you think, forget about the whole three divorce thing! Okay, I-I’ll go to my lawyer’s office right now and get this marriage annulled! Okay?! Because she means nothing to me! Noth—(leans down to Meg’s ear)—Nothing!!\n",
      "Meg Okay now I wouldn’t date you because you seem a little creepy.\n",
      "Karin I am so attracted to him right now.\n",
      "Chandler Okay, when are we gonna tell Rachel what is actually gonna happen?\n"

      "Phoebe I knew it! Because you love Rachel.\n",
      "Ross It’s not that. Okay? Annulments are more complicated than I…\n",
      "Phoebe Yeah, complicated ‘cause of the love.\n",
      "Ross I… I do, I do not love Rachel. I’m gonna tell her right now about the whole thing so we can get this marriage annulled as fast as possible. Okay? Would I do that if I loved her?\n",
      "Phoebe I’ve never been more convinced of your love for her.\n",

      "Rachel Thank you.\n",
      "Ross Of course.\n",
      "Joey So, Ross and Rachel got married, Monica and Chandler almost got married, do you think you and I should hook up?\n",
      "Phoebe Oh we do, but not just yet.\n",
      "Joey Really?! Well, when?\n",
      "Phoebe Okay umm, well, first Chandler and Monica will get married and be filthy rich by the way. Yeah. But it won’t work out.\n",
      "Joey Wow.\n",
      "Phoebe I know. Then, I’m gonna marry Chandler for the money and you’ll marry Rachel and have the beautiful kids.\n",
      "Joey Great!\n",
      "Phoebe But then we ditch those two and that’s when we get married. We’ll have Chandler’s money and Rachel’s kids and getting custody will be easy because of Rachel’s drinking problem.\n",
      "Joey Oh-oh, what about Ross?\n",
      "Phoebe I don’t want to go into the whole thing, but umm, we have words and I kill him.\n",

      "Chandler What? No, I want to watch this. (He turns on the television and the screen is completely covered in snow). Did your cable go out?\n",

      "Monica So do you think that these pictures—Are, are they trying to tell a story?\n",
      "Rachel Oh, yeah, sure. I mean, like in the case of this young woman, she has lost her clothes, so she rides naked on the horse, she’s crying out, ‘Where are they, where are they?’\n",
      "Monica Well, she’s not going to find them lying in the grass like that.\n",
      "Phoebe Oh, yeah. Aw, remember the days when you used to go out to the barn, lift up your shirt, and bend over?\n",
      "Rachel and Monica Yeah.\n",
      "Rachel You see, now, I would date this girl. She’s cute, she’s outdoorsy, you know, and she knows how to build a fire. I mean, that’s got to come in handy\n",

      "Joey Oh, you guys, with this joke. I gotta say, I know I cracked up, but I’m not even sure I got it.\n",
      "Ross What, you didn’t get it? The doctor is a monkey.\n",
      "Chandler And monkeys can’t write out prescriptions.\n",

      "Chandler So, you stole my joke, and you stole my money.\n",
      "Ross Well, I was going to stick it in the ATM, but now I think I’ll show the sexy teller that I am a published writer.\n",
      "Chandler Well, she is going to know that you stole the joke.\n",
      "Ross Oh, what are you going to do, follow me down there?\n",

      "Gunther Well, if you want, you can work here.\n",
      "Joey Uh, I don’t know. Ya see, it’s just, see I was a regular on a soap opera y’know? And to go from that to this, I just… Plus, I’d have to wait on all my friends.\n",

      "Chandler (visibly upset) He took my joke, he took it.\n",
      "Monica It’s wrong. You know what else is wrong? Phoebe picking Rachel.\n",
      "Chandler You know who else picked Rachel? Ross, and you know what else Ross did? He stole my joke. You know what? I’m going to get a joke journal. Y’know? And document the date and time of every single one of my jokes.\n",
      "Monica That’s a good idea.\n",
      "Chandler Yeah!\n",
      "Monica Do you know what’s a bad idea?\n",
      "Chandler Picking Rachel.\n",
      "Monica That’s right. (A noise comes from the living room.) Did you hear something?\n",
      "Chandler Maybe it’s the sound of Ross climbing into my brain and stealing my thoughts.\n",
      "Monica It’s coming from the living room.\n",

      "Rachel Monica, what are you doing?\n",
      "Monica (laughing harder) Nothing, I’m just trying to recreate some of the fun that we had at my place the other day. (To Phoebe) Remember, when you picked Rachel over me? That was funny.\n",
      "Phoebe I guess it was kinda funny.\n",
      "Monica (angrily) It wasn’t funny at all! Why would you do that? Why didn’t you pick me?\n",
      "Phoebe Fine. The reason that I was leaning a little bit more toward Rachel than you is just that you’re … just … kinda high maintenance—Okay let’s go to lunch!\n",
      "Monica That is completely untrue. You think I’m high maintenance? Okay, prove it. I want you to make a list and we’re going to go through it point by point!\n",
      "Phoebe No, okay, you’re right. You’re easy-going. You’re just not as easy-going as Rachel. She’s just more flexible and-and mellow. That’s all.\n",
      "Rachel (To Monica) Well, people are different.\n",
      "Phoebe Ya, you know, Rachel … she’ll do whatever you want. Y’know, you can just walk all over her.\n",
      "Rachel What? Wait a minute. What are you saying, that I’m a pushover? I’m not a pushover.\n",
      "Phoebe Oh, okay, (laughing) you’re not a pushover.\n",
      "Rachel Oh my … you think I’m a pushover. Well wait, watch this, you know what? You’re not invited to lunch. What do you think of that? I think that’s pretty strong, that’s what I think. Come on, Monica, let’s go to lunch. (She leaves)\n",
      "Monica (to Phoebe) You start working on that list. (She grabs her coat and leaves, too.)\n",
      "Rachel I cannot believe her.\n",
      "Monica I know. Where do you wanna go eat?\n",
      "Rachel Oh, oh, I love that Japanese place.\n",
      "Monica I’m sick of Japanese. We’re not going there.\n",
      "Rachel All right, wherever you wanna go is cool.\n",
      "Monica All right.\n",

      "Gunther Yeah, that-that Chandler cracks me up.\n",
      "Joey Hey Ross, listen, you want anything to drink, ‘cause I’m heading up there.\n",
      "Ross Uh, yeah, I’ll take a coffee. Thanks, man.\n",
      "Joey Sure. (To Monica and Rachel) Coffee? ‘Cause I’m going up there.\n",

      "Monica No, thank you.\n",

      "Joey You got it.\n",
      "Monica Joey, what are you doing?\n",
      "Joey Just being friendly. (He gives Monica a ‘what’s wrong with you?’ look and proceeds to walk behind the counter.)\n",
      "Rachel Joey, honey, I don’t think you’re supposed to go back there.\n",
      "Joey Nah, it’s okay. Right, Gunther? (Winks at him as if they’re in on a secret together.)\n",
      "Gunther Don’t wink at me. And put on your apron.\n",
      "Joey Okay, but I don’t see you asking any other paying customers to put on aprons.\n",
      "Monica Joey, do you work here?\n",
      "Joey No.\n",
      "Customer Hey, waiter.\n",
      "Joey Yeah?\n",
      "Monica Joey, what’s going on. What didn’t you tell us you work here?\n",
      "Joey It’s kind of embarrassing, y’know. I mean, I was an actor and now I’m a waiter. It’s supposed to go in the other direction.\n",
      "Chandler So is your apron. You’re wearing it like a cape.\n",
      "Joey I mean, the job’s easy and the money’s good, you know? I guess I’m going to be hanging out here anyway. I might as well get paid for it, right? I just feel kind of weird serving you guys.\n",
      "Rachel Come on, Joey, I did it and it was fine.\n",
      "Ross Yeah, why would it be weird? Hey, Joey, can I get some coffee?\n",
      "Joey Okay, I guess it doesn’t seem that weird.\n",
      "Ross Seriously, I-I asked you before and you still haven’t gotten it.\n",
      "Joey See, now it’s weird again.\n",
      "Chandler I think it’s great that you work here. You’re going to make a lot of money, and here’s your first tip: Don’t eat yellow snow. (He laughs, then picks up a pen, glares at Ross, and writes in his journal). Ah ha ha, 2:15, coffeehouse.\n",
      "Rachel Well, you know what? This is great. Finally, I have someone I can pass on my wisdom too. Let me tell you about a couple of things I learned while working at the coffeehouse. First of all, the customer is always right. (Joey nods.) A smile goes a long way. (Joey smiles) And if anyone is ever rude to you? Sneeze muffin.\n",
      "Joey Thanks, Rach. Look, you guys are just terrific. Y’know? Now, how about clearing out of here so I can get some new customers. It’s all about turnover.\n",
      "Ross Joey, seriously, can I get my coffee?\n",
      "Joey Oh, I’m sorry, Ross. I’ll get it for you right now. And since I made you wait, I’ll toss in a free muffin.\n",
      "Rachel Phoebe. We would like to talk to you for a second.\n",
      "Phoebe Okay.\n",
      "Monica So, maybe I am a little high maintenance. And maybe Rachel is a little bit of a pushover. But you know what we decided you are?\n",
      "Rachel Yes, we are very sorry to tell you this, but you, Phoebe, are flaky.\n",
      "Monica Hah!\n",
      "Phoebe That true, I am flaky.\n",
      "Rachel So, what, you’re just, you’re just okay with being flaky?\n",
      "Phoebe Yeah, totally.\n",
      "Monica Well, then, I’m okay with being high maintenance.\n",
      "Rachel Yeah, and I am okay with being a pushover.\n",
      "Phoebe That’s great. Good for you guys.\n",
      "Monica I am not high maintenance!\n",
      "Rachel I am not a pushover!\n",
      "Phoebe Who said you were?\n",
      "Monica and Rachel You did!\n",
      "Phoebe Oh, I’m flaky. I’ll say anything.\n",
      "Joey Hey, Gunther. Can you uh, can you cover for me? I just got an audition.\n",
      "Gunther No, I’m leaving to get my hair dyed.\n",
      "Joey Really?! I like your natural color. Come on man, it’s a great part. Look, check it out. I’m the lead guy’s best friend and I wait for him in this bar and save his seat. Listen-listen. ‘I’m sorry, that seat’s saved.’\n",
      "Gunther That’s the whole part?\n",
      "Joey Okay, maybe he’s not his best friend, but …\n",
      "Gunther Okay, I’ll see you in an hour.\n",
      "Joey Oh, man, I could totally get that part. ‘I’m sorry, that seat is taken.’\n",
      "Patron Oh, excuse me.\n",
      "Joey No, no, I didn’t mean you. But, you believed me, huh?\n",
      "Patron I believed you were saving this seat for someone.\n",
      "Joey So, you’d hire me, right?\n",
      "Patron For what?\n",
      "Joey Exactly! All right, everybody, listen up. The coffeehouse is going to be closed for about an hour.\n",
      "Customers Huh? What?\n",
      "Joey Yeah, it’s for the kids. To keep the kids off drugs. It’s a very important issue in this month’s Playboy. I’m sure you all read about it.\n",
      "Ross It’s my joke.\n",
      "Chandler It’s my joke.\n",
      "Ross and Chandler It’s my joke.\n",
      "Ross Y’know, I don’t think we’re going to settle this.\n",
      "Chandler Let’s have Monica decide.\n",
      "Ross Yeah!\n",
      "Chandler Yeah!\n",
      "Ross Hey Mon.\n",
      "Chandler Mon, get out here!\n",
      "Ross Monica! (She appears, not sure why she was summoned.)\n",
      "Chandler Okay, okay. You have to help us decide whose joke this is.\n",
      "Monica Why do I have to decide?\n",
      "Chandler Because you’re the only one that can be fair.\n",
      "Ross Yeah.\n",
      "Monica I can’t be fair. You’re my boyfriend.\n",
      "Ross Yeah, but I’m your brother. We’re family. That’s the most important thing in the world.\n",
      "Chandler (to Ross) Don’t try to sway her. (To Monica) (Softly) I’m your only chance to have a baby. Okay, let’s go.\n",
      "Ross We’ll each tell you how we came up with the joke and then you decide which one of us is telling the truth—me.\n",
      "Monica Okay, Chandler, you go first.\n",
      "Chandler Okay, I thought of the joke two months ago at lunch with Steve.\n",
      "Monica Oh, wait, is he the guy I met at Christmas?\n",
      "Chandler Can I finish my story?!\n",
      "Monica Do you want me to pick you?!\n",
      "Ross See, I would never snap at you like that.\n",
      "Monica Continue.\n",
      "Chandler So Steve said he had to go to the doctor. And Steve’s doctor’s name is Doctor Muppy. So I said, ‘Doctor Monkey?’ And that is how the whole Doctor Monkey thing came up. (He slams his feet up on the table to emphasize his point.)\n",
      "Ross Are you kidding? Okay, look. I-I studied evolution. Remember, evolution? Monkey into man? Plus, I’m a doctor, and I had a monkey. I’m Doctor Monkey!\n",
      "Chandler I’m not arguing with that.\n",
      "Monica All right, I’ve heard enough. I’ve made my decision.\n",
      "Monica You are both idiots. The joke is not funny, and it’s offensive to women, and doctors, and monkeys! You shouldn’t be arguing over who gets credit, you should be arguing over who gets blamed for inflicting this horrible joke upon the world! Now let it go! The joke sucks!\n",
      "Ross It’s your joke.\n",
      "Chandler Is not.\n",
      "Monica Hi, Chandler. There you are.\n",
      "Chandler Hi, oh hi.\n",
      "Monica Hey, it’s Phoebe and Rachel. Um, why don’t you tell them what you were telling me earlier about me not being high maintenance?\n",
      "Chandler (starts to recite a rehearsed speech) Monica is a self-sufficient, together lady. (Pause.) Being with her has been like being on a vacation. And what may be perceived as high maintenance is merely attention to detail and—(He falters and Monica prompts him.)—generosity of spirit.\n",
      "Rachel Wow, you know what? That is the best fake speech I think I’ve ever heard.\n",
      "Phoebe Really? I’ve heard better.\n",
      "Monica Wait, wait, he came up with that himself. Tell them, Chandler.\n",
      "Chandler (To Chandler) I’m out of words. Should I just say the whole thing again?\n",
      "Monica Look, I am not high maintenance. I am not. Chandler!\n",
      "Chandler (pauses as he struggles with what he has to say) You’re a little high maintenance.\n",
      "Monica Ahhh! You are on my list.\n",
      "Chandler I’m sorry. You’re not easy-going, but you’re passionate, and that’s good. And when you get upset about the little things, I think that I’m pretty good about making you feel better about that. And that’s good too. So, they can say that you’re high maintenance, but it’s okay, because I like … maintaining you.\n",
      "Monica (embarrassed) (To Phoebe and Rachel) I didn’t even tell him to say that. (They hug). All right you’re off my list.\n",
      "Chandler (happily) I’m off the list. (Sits on the couch.)\n",
      "Monica (sits next to him) Phoebe, it’s okay that you don’t want me to be your girlfriend because I have the best boyfriend.\n",
      "Phoebe (to Monica) Y’know, suddenly I find you very attractive.\n",
      "Chandler Hey, buddy boy, how’d the audition go?\n",
      "Joey Not good, no. I didn’t get the part, and I lost my job here, so …\n",
      "Phoebe Wow! That is a bad audition.\n",
      "Rachel How-how did you lose your job here?\n",
      "Joey Well, I had the audition but Gunther said I had to stay here and be in charge so he could go get his hair dyed. So, I went anyway, and then he fired me.\n",
      "Rachel He left work in the middle of the day to do a personal errand and left you in charge when you’ve been working here two days? That’s not, that’s not right.\n",
      "Joey Yeah, what are ya gonna do?\n",
      "Rachel Joey, you can’t let him get away with that. Ya know what, I’m not going to let him get away with that. I’m going to say something to him—No, I really shouldn’t say anything—No, I should say something to him. (Goes to the counter) Gunther, I want you to give Joey his job back. That is really not fair that you have to fire him…\n",
      "Gunther Okay.\n",
      "Rachel What?\n",
      "Gunther He can have his job back.\n",
      "Rachel That’s right, he can have his job back. I’m glad we got that all straightened out. There you go, Joey, you got your job back.\n",
      "Joey That’s great. Thanks Rach.\n",
      "Rachel Yeah, pretty nice, huh? Now who’s a pushover?\n",
      "Phoebe (returning from the bathroom) Rach, you’re in my seat.\n",
      "Rachel Oh, I’m sorry. (Gets up and moves.)\n",
      "Phoebe Hey, I never got to hear who you guys would pick to be your girlfriend.\n",
      "Monica I pick you, Phoebe.\n",
      "Rachel Oh, yeah. Definitely you, Pheebs.\n",
      "Phoebe Yeah, well, I kinda thought.\n",
      "Chandler Hey.\n",
      "Rachel Hey. Oh, I have a question. If-if-if one of you had to pick one of the other two guys to go out with, who would you pick?\n",
      "Ross No way.\n",
      "Joey I’m not answering that.\n",
      "Chandler Joey! (Pause as they all stare at him.) No way. I’m not answering that.\n",

      "Joey No-no, I can’t! I can’t! Not after the other night, it’s just it’s…too weird, okay? Don’t tell her I’m here! (Turns to run to the bathroom and his bagel falls off the plate onto the floor.) Don’t eat that! (Runs to the bathroom as Rachel enters.)\n",
      "Rachel Hey!\n",
      "Chandler Hey!\n",
      "Monica Hey Rachel!\n",
      "Rachel Is Joey here?\n",

      "Monica I don’t see him. Hey! Maybe he’s in the sugar bowl! (Opens the sugar bowl) Joey? Nope! (Closes the sugar bowl and they both laugh.)\n",
      "Rachel Well, at least you make each other laugh.\n",
      "Monica What’s up?\n",
      "Rachel Well, I haven’t seen him since that night that he told me how he y’know… I don’t know, I think he’s avoiding me. Why is that bagel on the floor?\n",
      "Monica We were playing a game.\n",
      "Rachel Ew, was Chandler naked? Sort of like a, like a ring toss kind of situation?\n",
      "Monica Sure.\n",
      "Chandler What?! No! No!\n",
      "Rachel All right. Well listen, if you see Joey will you just tell him uh…tell him I miss him. (Exits and Joey enters.)\n",
      "Monica (To Joey) Okay, did you hear that?\n",
      "Joey Yeah, a naked bagel game? (Picks up his dropped bagel.) (To Chandler) Dude, I don’t know. That’s a pretty small hole.\n",
      "Monica Honey, you gotta talk to her.\n",
      "Joey I can’t! Y’know? You guys don’t know what it’s like to put yourself out there like that and just get shot down.\n",
      "Chandler (incredulous) I don’t know what that’s like?! Up until I was 25 I thought the only response to, \"I love you,\" was, \"Oh crap!\"\n",
      "Monica Hello? No rejection? I got shot down at fat camp! Boy, kids are mean when they’re hungry.\n",
      "Joey All right so, so what do I do?\n",
      "Monica This is Rachel. I mean, what are you gonna do, never going to talk to her again? I mean I know it’s weird, it’s awkward, but you gotta at least try.\n",
      "Joey Yeah. Okay. (Goes to take a bite out of the previously mentioned bagel.) Whoa! (Stops.) I almost forgot this was on your…\n",
      "Chandler (interrupting him) We didn’t play it!!\n",
      "Phoebe Okay, so when you’re done with your tea I’ll look at your leaves and tell you your fortune.\n",
      "Chandler I didn’t know you read tea leaves.\n",
      "Phoebe Oh yeah, I’ve done it for years. I actually stopped because I was so accurate. Y’know, and-and y’know, one of the great joys of life is it’s-it’s wondrous unpredictability. Y’know? And also tea tends to give me the trots.\n",
      "Monica Okay, I’m done. Read mine.\n",
      "Phoebe Okay. (Looks at the leaves.) Ooh, I see a ladder. (Checks the book) Which can mean either a promotion or a violent death.\n",
      "Monica (stunned) I-I’m the head chef. I-I can’t get promoted.\n",
      "Phoebe Uh-hmm. Uh-hmm, who’s next?\n",
      "Rachel Okay, I’m done. Do mine.\n",
      "Phoebe Okay. (Reads the leaves) Umm, oh! Okay, I see a circle.\n",
      "Rachel Ah.\n",
      "Phoebe Oh! (Checking the book) Which can either mean you’re having a baby or you’re gonna make a scientific discovery!\n",
      "Rachel Well, I have been spending a lot of time in the lab.\n",
      "Chandler What does yours say Pheebs?\n",
      "Phoebe Umm… Wow, all right. (Checks the book.) Wow! Yay! Ooh, I’m gonna meet a guy! And really soon! And he’s gonna be the man of my dreams. Probably not the guy I had a dream about last night. (Points at Chandler.)\n",
      "Ross (entering) Hey! Has anyone seen my shirt? It’s a button down, like a, like a faded salmon?\n",
      "Monica You mean your pink shirt?\n",
      "Ross Faded salmon color.\n",
      "Monica No, I-I haven’t seen your pink shirt.\n",
      "Ross Great! Great. Then I must’ve left it at Mona’s. I knew it!\n",
      "Chandler Well, I’m sure you get another one at Ann Taylor’s.\n",
      "Ross That’s my favorite shirt! Okay? I love that shirt!\n",
      "Rachel Well just ask Mona to give it back!\n",
      "Ross I don’t know. I mean I-I guess I could. It’s just that we didn’t really end things such good terms. And if I go over there I’d be ignoring the one thing she asked me to do when we broke up, jump up my own ass and die. (Walks away.)\n",
      "Phoebe (noticing a guy sitting by the green post looking at her) Oh wait a second you guys…for the last couple weeks I’ve been that guy everywhere I go. We take the same bus. We go to the same bookstore, the same dry cleaners; maybe he’s the tea guy. (He gets up to leave, and smiles at Phoebe.)\n",
      "Chandler Phoebe, did you see that?! He totally checked you out! He is so cute! (Looking at his tea.) Mine has a picture of The Village People, what does that mean?\n",
      "Rachel Hi!\n",
      "Joey Hey.\n",
      "Rachel Hi.\n",
      "Joey Hi.\n",
      "Monica Tea gives Phoebe the trots.\n",
      "Rachel So I thought Joey and I would be okay once we hung out, but it’s not even like we know how to be with each other anymore.\n",
      "Chandler I know it’s tough now, but things will get better.\n",
      "Rachel How do you know that? What if it just gets worse and worse and worse, to the point where we can’t even be in the same room with each other?!\n",
      "Chandler I’m not great at the advice, can I interest you in a sarcastic comment? Some cheese?\n",
      "Monica Honey, what is the Bruce Springsteen CD in the Kat Stevens case?\n",
      "Chandler Let’s just say if I can’t find the right CD case I just put it in the nearest one.\n",
      "Monica Okay, where is the Kat Stevens CD?\n",
      "Chandler In the James Taylor case.\n",
      "Monica Where is the James Taylor CD?\n",
      "Chandler Honey, I’m gonna save you some time, 200 CDs, not one of them in the right case.\n",
      "Monica Okay. No need to panic. Deep breathes everyone. Okay umm uh, we’re just gonna have to spend some time and put the CDs in the right cases.\n",
      "Chandler Well, if we’re gonna do that we should come up with some kind of order. Y’know alphabetically or by genre?\n",
      "Monica Hmm, I don’t know. We really have to talk this through.\n",
      "Rachel Oh my God!! You guys have such problems!! I feel so terrible for you!\n",
      "Monica Okay, I-I’m sorry. You and Joey, your both focusing on this uncomfortable thing, what you need to do is to change the subject. Next time you see him try to get him talking about something else.\n",
      "Rachel Oh yeah. That makes sense.\n",
      "Monica Yeah, like I don’t know, maybe you have a work problem that you need his advice on.\n",
      "Rachel Ooh, I can do that.\n",
      "Monica Good. (To Chandler) Uh honey, the Miami Vice soundtrack? Really?\n",
      "Chandler They were just giving those away at the store (off Monica’s look) in exchange for money.\n",
      "Joey (entering) Hey!\n",
      "Rachel Hi.\n",
      "Monica Uh I really don’t know what to tell you Rach, I really don’t. I mean, maybe Joey can help you out with your, with your big work problem.\n",
      "Rachel What?\n",
      "Monica Yeah Joey she’s…Rachel’s got this really big work problem, and it is a head scratcher. Wow! (To Chandler) Y’know what, if we’re gonna make dinner we’re gonna have to leave. Yeah. (She and Chandler exit.)\n",
      "Joey So you uh, have a…big work problem?\n",
      "Rachel Yeah it’s umm… Yeah it’s uh… It-it’s y’know—It’s nothing.\n",
      "Joey Huh. Okay. (Awkward silence.) So uh, I think I’m gonna take off.\n",
      "Rachel Yeah—No wait! Joey no wait it is. It’s something. It’s-it’s umm…it’s my boss.\n",
      "Joey Yeah?\n",
      "Rachel Yeah, and umm my baby.\n",
      "Joey Yeah?\n",
      "Rachel My boss wants to buy my baby!\n",
      "Joey What?! Oh my-oh my God!\n",
      "Rachel I know I told you, it’s a really big problem.\n",
      "Joey What he wants to buy your baby?!\n",
      "Rachel Can you believe that?!\n",
      "Joey That’s crazy!\n",
      "Rachel That’s what I told him!\n",
      "Joey Okay, how did this even happen?\n",
      "Rachel Well I’ll tell ya! (Pause) See uh my-my boss and his wife—They-they can’t have children. So umm, and that—we were at the Christmas party, and he got drunk, and he said to me, \"Rachel, I want to buy your baby.\"\n",
      "Joey Man! When you said it was a problem about your boss and the baby I figured it was something about maternity leave.\n",
      "Rachel Ohh! Yeah! (Pause) Yeah that-that would’ve been a much simpler problem.\n",
      "Phoebe Oh hello.\n",
      "Guy Oh, it’s you. I see you everywhere. I’m Jim, Jim Nelson.\n",
      "Phoebe Oh Jim, Jim Nelson I’m Phoebe, Phoebe Buffay. We certainly have been seeing a lot of each other lately.\n",
      "Jim We have. Maybe we’ll be seeing each other at dinner tomorrow night, say around 8 o’clock?\n",
      "Phoebe Well, maybe we will. (Starts to walk away.) Oh! (She turns around and the exchange information.)\n",
      "Ross Mona? (There’s no answer, so he starts to leave but remembers where her extra key is. He reaches atop a hall light just outside her door and grabs the key. He looks at in triumph as the pain from it being hot moves along his nervous system to his brain, and when it arrives his brain orders his hand to drop the hot key and his mouth to squeal in pain. After dropping the key he pulls his shirtsleeve over his hand and uses the key to open the door and enter Mona’s apartment.) Okay, if I were a salmon shirt, where would I be? (He hears a key in the door and as it opens he dives behind the couch.)\n",
      "Mona (entering, with her date) I am so sorry I spilled wine all over your shirt.\n",

      "Mona No, it’s still wet. Y’know what? Let me get it out before it sets. Ooh, I have something you can wear. Here. (Hands him Ross’s shirt.)\n",
      "Mona's Date Oh umm, I-I don’t know if I want to wear a woman’s shirt.\n",
      "Mona No-no that’s a man’s shirt.\n",
      "Mona's Date It’s awfully pink. (Ross mouths, \"It’s salmon!\")\n",

      "Monica Yeah? The work problem?\n",
      "Rachel Oh it was perfect! I mean it really felt like he was my friend again.\n",
      "Chandler What problem did you tell him you had?\n",
      "Rachel Oh that’s not important. The point is, I really—I think everything’s gonna be okay.\n",
      "Mr. Zelner May I help you?\n",
      "Joey Do you think you can just buy my friends baby?!\n",

      "Phoebe Oh, witty banter. Well done.\n",
      "Jim So, tell me a little bit about yourself.\n",

      "Phoebe (a little freaked out) So! Umm, anyway I-I lived in New York, someone wildly I guess, for umm—Well since I was fourteen.\n",
      "Jim I’m sorry. I’m staring. It’s just that you have the most beautiful eyes.\n",
      "Phoebe Oh stop it.\n",
      "Jim And your breasts! Hmm!!!\n",
      "Phoebe Okay. Umm look, you’re coming on a little strong. But I’m going to give you the benefit of the doubt, because it seems the universe really wants to be together. So, why don’t we just start over okay? And you can just tell me about yourself.\n",

      "Rachel Well can we see it?! Oh maybe we shouldn’t. I mean if she just died this morning out of respect.\n",
      "Ross Yeah. No. No you’re right.\n",
      "Rachel Shall we?\n",
      "Ross Yeah.\n",
      "Mrs. Verhoeven's Daughter Yes?\n",
      "Ross Hi. I’m Ross Geller. I live in the building.\n",
      "Rachel And I’m Rachel, an admirer of the building.\n",
      "Ross I-I heard about Mrs. Verhoeven passing away and I’m so sorry for your loss.\n",
      "Mrs. Verhoeven's Daughter She didn’t pass.\n",
      "Ross What?\n",
      "Mrs. Verhoeven's Daughter My mother’s still alive.\n",
      "Ross Oh, thank God!\n",
      "Mrs. Verhoeven's Daughter It looked like we were gonna lose her this morning, but she’s a tough old bird.\n",
      "Rachel Ahh.\n",
      "Mrs. Verhoeven's Daughter Are you close with her?\n",
      "Ross Of course! Uh yeah, she and I would talk all the time in-in (Rachel pokes her head in and starts to look around) the laundry room. (Pushes Rachel out of the way.)\n",
      "Mrs. Verhoeven's Daughter You speak Dutch? (In Dutch) Zeer vereerd een vriend van mijn moeder te ontmoeten. (Translation: I’m very honored to meet a friend of my mother.)\n",
      "Ross Y’know I would it’s just painful.\n",
      "Rachel So she’s really not dead.\n",
      "Mrs. Verhoeven's Daughter No, she’s hanging in there.\n",
      "Rachel Hmm. Do you think—Could you tell me if she’s hanging in, in a one bedroom or a two?\n",
      "Brenda Mrs. Bing, this tile cleaner is incredible! Where’d you get it?\n",
      "Monica Oh well umm, I make it myself! It’s two parts ammonia and one part lemon juice. And now the secret ingredient is…y’know what? We just met.\n",
      "Brenda Okay. Uhh, I’m gonna go get the clothes from the laundry room now. And, when I come back I’ll clean behind the refrigerator.\n",
      "Monica (To Chandler) I love her.\n",
      "Brenda I’ll be back in a minute.\n",
      "Monica Okay. (As Brenda exits Monica notices something.)\n",
      "Chandler See? I told you.\n",
      "Monica She stole my jeans!\n",
      "Chandler (pause) What?\n",
      "Monica I have been looking for them all week and she is wearing them!\n",
      "Chandler So she stole your pants and then she came back and wore them in front of you?\n",
      "Monica Don’t you see? It’s the perfect crime!\n",
      "Chandler She must’ve been planning this for years!\n",
      "Monica I will prove it to you! Okay? About a week ago I was wearing those jeans and I dropped a pen in my lap and it left an ink stain on the crotch. Now when she comes back I will find it and show you that stain!\n",
      "Chandler Honey, isn’t it possible that the company that sold the jeans made more than just the one pair?\n",
      "Monica I guess.\n",
      "Chandler So, shouldn’t we go give her the benefit of the doubt before we go…snooping around her crotch?\n",
      "Monica Fine. I’m just glad I didn’t give her my secret ingredient.\n",
      "Chandler Out of curiosity, what is your secret ingredient?\n",
      "Monica Yeah! (Laughs.)\n",
      "Phoebe Hi!\n",
      "Eric Come in, I’m so glad you’re here.\n",
      "Phoebe Yeah, me too. Not in the shaky angry way you are though.\n",
      "Eric Sorry, I just saw Ursula. I had to give the engagement ring back.\n",
      "Phoebe Oh.\n",
      "Eric Just seeing her brought it all back. All the lies, the way she used me. I just…I got so angry just looking at her…(Looks at Phoebe)…face.\n",
      "Phoebe Yeah. (Covers her face with her hand.) Yeah.\n",
      "Eric I’m sorry. I just…when I look at you I see her. When I see her I get a little bit angry.\n",
      "Phoebe Maybe this is too weird.\n",
      "Eric No wait! There’s only a problem when I look at you. (Sits down on the couch.) Oh I got it! I got it. (Puts his hands to his eyes.)\n",
      "Phoebe No don’t tear out your eyes!!\n",
      "Eric I was just, I was just gonna take out my lenses.\n",
      "Phoebe Oh, yeah try that. (He finishes and looks at her.) So, is that better?\n",
      "Eric Not really. You…you’re blurry, but you still look like Ursula. You’re Blursula. Okay wait. Maybe…If I-if I just don’t look at you for a while. (Stands up and turns his back to her.) See? It…it works. I’m not, I’m not angry at all anymore! This is a great date!\n",
      "Phoebe Look Eric, turn around. (He does so.) Look, I like you, but it shouldn’t be this hard. Y’know? This is our first date y’know? First dates are supposed to be about excitement and electricity and ‘Ooh, he just touched my hand, did he mean to touch my hand?’ and y’know first kisses and…(He kisses her)…second kisses. (Motions for him to kiss her again which he does and they start to make out.)\n",
      "Ross Thanks for the coffee, or bedankt voor de koffie, Gunter. (He translates that phrase into Dutch.)\n",
      "Gunther Jij spreekt Nederlands? Dat is te gek. Heb je familie daar? (Translation: You speak Dutch  That's cool.  Do you have relatives there?)\n",
      "Ross Yeah, we’re done.\n",
      "Gunther Ezel. (Translation: Donkey)\n",
      "Ross Ezel? Ezel? Ezel? (Looks it up in his book.)\n",
      "Joey (entering) Hey Ross! Listen, do you want to go see that new Imax movie on tide pools?\n",
      "Ross Really?!\n",
      "Joey (laughs) No. But I got Knicks tickets for you, me, and Chandler.\n",
      "Ross Sweet!\n",
      "Joey All right, well finish your coffee; let’s go.\n",
      "Ross Okay I-I just have to stop by my place first.\n",
      "Joey To tape the game? You do this every time Ross, you’re not gonna be on TV!\n",
      "Ross No-no, I-I have to see if this apartment became available.\n",
      "Joey Oh, you’re switching apartments?\n",
      "Ross It’s not for me, it’s for Rachel.\n",
      "Joey But Rachel has an apartment.\n",
      "Ross Yeah, but when the baby comes she’s gonna want to move.\n",
      "Joey She is?\n",
      "Ross Yeah, you didn’t expect her to live there with a baby did you?\n",
      "Joey I guess I didn’t really think about it.\n",
      "Ross (finds the word in the book) Ezel! (Reads the translation.) Hey Gunther! You’re an ezel!\n",
      "Gunther Jij hebt seks met ezels. (Translation: You have sex with donkeys.)\n",
      "Ross Damnit!\n",
      "Monica Nice jeans!\n",
      "Brenda Oh thanks! I like your top.\n",
      "Monica Oh. (Holds on to it.) (To herself) You’re not gettin’ it.\n",
      "Brenda What happened?!\n",
      "Monica Oh, I fell asleep.\n",
      "Brenda I was thinking about taking my lunch break.\n",
      "Monica Oh, will you do the top of the cabinets? That’ll really work up your appetite for lunch.\n",
      "Brenda All right.\n",
      "Monica Hello.\n",
      "Brenda What’s going on?!\n",
      "Monica I’m sorry. I’ve never had a maid before, is this not okay?\n",
      "Rachel Hey!\n",
      "Joey Hey!\n",
      "Rachel How was the game?\n",
      "Joey Oh, okay. I…I ate way too much.\n",
      "Rachel Oh.\n",
      "Joey Ooh. (Notices the pizza, grabs a slice, and takes a bite.) So umm, I was talkin’ to Ross and he said you were looking for a new place.\n",
      "Rachel Oh yeah! Hopefully across the street if certain Dutch people would just let go.\n",
      "Joey I was kinda hoping you’d stay.\n",
      "Rachel Oh but Joey, I have to go. There’s no room for a baby here.\n",
      "Joey No room? It’s a baby. It’s like this big. (Holds his hands about a foot apart.) Y’know, I mean you-you could you could put it over here. (A desk.) Or-or-or we could put it right here. (The chair.) Aw, it’s cute, right? Or-or we could put it over here. (By the bathroom door.) You wouldn’t even notice it. Where’s the baby? (Mumbles that it’s over in the corner.)\n",
      "Rachel Honey, it’s not just a matter of where you put it. I mean a baby changes everything. They cry all the time. I mean imagine bringing home some girl and trying to score when there’s a screaming baby around.\n",
      "Joey I could use a challenge! It’s getting pretty easy.\n",
      "Rachel Honey, it’s so sweet that you want me to stay, but I-I can’t do that to you. I mean it would disrupt your entire life.\n",
      "Joey I love living with you so much. I just wish things didn’t have to change.\n",
      "Rachel I know.\n",
      "Joey Y’know I blame Ross for this.\n",
      "Rachel I do too a little bit.\n",
      "Joey I’m gonna miss you, you’re the hottest roommate I ever had.\n",
      "Phoebe Ooh, oh no! I have to go! I have a massage appointment.\n",
      "Eric Oh no, stay here we’ll keep doing this. I’ll pay you.\n",
      "Phoebe No, I got in trouble for that before. I’ll see you later.\n",
      "Eric Absolutely. (They kiss and Phoebe heads for the door.) I love the way you kiss.\n",
      "Phoebe Really? That’s the thing I’m worse at! You’ll see. (Exits.)\n",
      "Chandler (entering) Hi!\n",
      "Monica Hey! Umm, I think Brenda needs a raise.\n",
      "Chandler How come?\n",
      "Monica Because I put my head between her legs.\n",
      "Chandler To see her pants?\n",
      "Monica They’re my pants!\n",
      "Chandler Are you sure? Did you see the stain?\n",
      "Monica No! I was just getting into position and then everything went dark.\n",
      "Chandler God! She is not stealing from us! Okay, will you let this go?\n",
      "Monica Fine. (Brenda comes in to use the bathroom and adjusts her pink bra strap on the way.) She’s wearing my bra!\n",
      "Chandler Oh dear God!\n",
      "Monica My pink flowered bra! I recognize the strap!\n",
      "Chandler And yet you don’t recognize that you’re crazy.\n",
      "Monica Here’s the plan! Okay? I’m going to leave you get a look at Brenda’s bra!\n",
      "Chandler Here’s another plan…No!\n",
      "Monica I would do it but she thinks I’m attracted to her!\n",
      "Chandler Why?\n",
      "Monica Did you not hear where my head was? Come on! Come on we’re a team! We’re in this together!\n",
      "Chandler I fear a jury will see it the same way!\n",
      "Monica Do this for me! Come on, I catch you looking at woman’s breasts all the time!\n",
      "Chandler You see that?\n",
      "Monica Do you see this? (Mimics him drooling over a woman’s breasts.)\n",
      "Chandler All right. Yes. Okay. I get your point. But if it’s not your bra will you just let the woman clean the apartment?!\n",
      "Monica Yes! Absolutely. Okay? Look, you’ll know it’s mine because on the right cup, the lacey part, there’s a very noticeable rip.\n",
      "Chandler You need new clothes.\n",
      "Ross Hi. How is she?\n",
      "Mrs. Verhoeven's Daughter It’s not looking good.\n",
      "Ross (happily) Oh. (Realizes then sadly) Oh. Well I uh, I brought her some bloemen. (Flowers in Dutch.)\n",
      "Mrs. Verhoeven's Daughter That’s so sweet. (Takes the flowers.) Would you like to come in and say good-bye? I’m sure it would mean a lot to her.\n",
      "Ross Oh I don’t know that it would.\n",
      "Mrs. Verhoeven's Daughter Well, her memory is pretty much gone.\n",
      "Ross All right then. (Follows her in and checks the place out.)\n",
      "Phoebe (entering) Hey!\n",
      "Eric Welcome back!\n",
      "Phoebe Hey! (Jumps on the bed with him.) Can we pick up where we left off?\n",
      "Eric I don’t know, I’m still pretty tired out from this afternoon.\n",
      "Phoebe Why?\n",
      "Eric Uh, the sex.\n",
      "Phoebe What sex?\n",
      "Eric Our sex.\n",
      "Phoebe We didn’t have sex.\n",
      "Eric Well if I didn’t have sex with you, I had sex with someone that looked an awful lot like…\n",
      "Phoebe (simultaneously as Eric) Ew! Ew! Ew! Ew! Ew! Ew!\n",
      "Eric (simultaneously as Phoebe) Oh no! Oh no! Oh no! Oh no! No! No! No!\n",
      "Phoebe You-you…you had sex with Ursula?!\n",
      "Eric Uh, a little bit. She-she-she walked in and I thought she was you and I kissed her and…\n",
      "Phoebe You didn’t notice she was wearing different clothes?!\n",
      "Eric Well I was just so excited to see you.\n",
      "Phoebe Oh. Ew! Ew! Ew! Ugh! Y’know what? This is too weird.\n",
      "Eric No-no it’s not! I don’t want to lose you! It’s-it’s like I was saying to Ursula when I was making love to her and I thought she was you—Yeah it is too weird.\n",
      "Phoebe So I guess this is it.\n",
      "Eric Yeah. (They hug.) Maybe it’s for the best. You smell just like her.\n",
      "Phoebe Yeah, so do you.\n",
      "Brenda (noticing him) What are you doing?\n",
      "Chandler I’m leaning. This is where I lean.\n",
      "Brenda Okay. (Goes over and fluffs up the pillows on the couch.\n",
      "Chandler Brenda a bee!\n",
      "Brenda What?\n",
      "Chandler Yes! It’s flown into your blouse and you’d better undo your buttons lest it sting you!\n",
      "Brenda I think I know what’s going on here.\n",
      "Chandler You do?\n",
      "Brenda Look, I know it must be hard that your wife is a lesbian, but it’s wrong. You’re married.\n",
      "Chandler I totally understand. (They both laugh.) Can I just see your bra?\n",
      "Rachel Hi!\n",
      "Monica (looking at Rachel’s jeans) Where did you get those jeans?!\n",
      "Rachel You gave them to me!\n",
      "Monica No I didn’t!\n",
      "Rachel All right, I took them. But I figured it would be okay because you got a big ink stain on the crotch.\n",
      "Monica Oh no! Did you take my bra too?!\n",
      "Rachel What bra?\n",
      "Monica The pink one with the flowers?!\n",
      "Rachel You mean the one that you’re wearing? (Adjusts Monica’s pink bra strap as Monica looks down her shirt.)\n",
      "Brenda (entering) I quit! (Storms off.)\n",
      "Monica Sounds about right.\n",
      "Rachel What is this?\n",
      "Joey Hey! Uh, this is just to give you an idea. Okay well, we can put screens here, (In front of the crib.) so that the baby has privacy, and-and-and maybe a mobile over the crib. And uh—Oh look! Here’s a baby monitor (Holds it up), which until the baby comes we can use as walkie-talkies. Huh?\n",
      "Rachel You’re so sweet. (Notices something in the crib.) Oh my God! And you gave the baby Hugsy! (A stuffed penguin wearing a ski jacket, goggles, and hat.)\n",
      "Joey Ahhhhhhhhhhhh…. That-that-that’s really just to show where the baby would go. Y’know why don’t I hold on to him so that there’s no confusion? (Takes him back, sets him on the chair, and apologizes to him.)\n",
      "Rachel But Joey the baby is going to be crying, it’s going to be loud.\n",
      "Joey I’m loud!\n",
      "Rachel It’s gonna be up all night!\n",
      "Joey I’m up all night!\n",
      "Rachel It’s gonna poop!\n",
      "Joey Hello!\n",
      "Rachel What about all the women you want to bring home?\n",
      "Joey Look, if I’m bringing home a woman who can’t stand being around a baby, then maybe I don’t want to be with that woman! Or maybe we’ll just do it in the bathroom of the club!\n",
      "Rachel Joey, are you sure?\n",
      "Joey Yeah! All right—Look, I know sometimes it’ll be hard, okay? But, it’ll also be really…really great. Please Rachel! I-I-I really want you to stay.\n",
      "Rachel I want me to stay too.\n",
      "Joey Ohh!\n",
      "Rachel Thank you. (They hug.) Oh Joey and look at this crib! It’s so cute!\n",
      "Joey I know! I found it on the street.\n",
      "Rachel Are you serious—Really?! It’s in such good condition.\n",
      "Joey Yeah.\n",
      "Rachel Wow! Whoa-whoa what’s under the covers?\n",
      "Joey I don’t know.\n",
      "Rachel It’s moving.\n",
      "Joey Ew.\n",
      "Rachel It’s still—(Screams)—It’s got a tail! Get it out of here! Get it out of here!!\n",
      "Joey Ooh! Ah! Okay! (Quickly drags the crib outside.)\n",
      "Ross Well, the old lady died. And how do I know? Her dying wish was for one last kiss. But I don’t care, (To Rachel) because you got the apartment. Yes!\n",
      "Rachel Ewww. Yeah. Umm. I think I’m gonna stay here.\n",
      "Joey Isn’t that great?\n",
      "Ross (stutters looking for words) Ezels!!\n",

      "DR. BURKE Oh, well obviously you know Barbara and I split up, otherwise you wouldn't have done the head tilt.\n",
      "MONICA The head tilt?\n",
      "DR. BURKE Yeah, since the divorce, when anybody asks me how I am, it's always with a sympathetic head tilt. [demonstrating] 'How ya doin'? You OK?'\n",
      "MONICA I'm sorry.\n",
      "DR. BURKE No no, it, it's fine, believe me. I do it too. I always answer with the 'I'm OK' head bob. [demonstrates] 'I'm OK.' [tilts head] 'You sure?' [bobs head] 'Yeah, I'm fine.' Hey listen, I've got to set up the music. I got a new CD changer, of course the divorce only left me with 4 CD's to change.\n",
      "MONICA [her and Phoebe tilt their heads] Oh, that's too bad.\n",
      "DR. BURKE [bobbing his head] I'll survive.\n",

      "MONICA If it makes anybody feel better, then we can just forget the thing, and we'll just do the gift.\n",
      "ROSS G-gift? The thing's not the gift?\n",
      "CHANDLER No, the thing was, we were gonna go see Hootie and the Blowfish.\n",
      "ROSS Hootie and the--oh my. I, I can catch them on the radio.\n",
      "PHOEBE No, now I feel bad. You wanna go to the concert.\n",
      "ROSS No, look, hey, it's my birthday, and the important thing is that we all be together.\n",

      "PHOEBE Oh, it's like a skit.\n",
      "MONICA Why, it's dinner for six. 5 steaks, and an eggplant for Phoebe.\n",
      "ROSS Whoo!\n",
      "PHOEBE Cool.\n",
      "MONICA Yeah, we switched meat suppliers at work, and the new guys gave me the steaks as sort of a thank-you.\n",
      "ROSS But wait, there's more. Hey, Chandler, what is in the envelope?\n",
      "CHANDLER By the way, this didn't seem so dorky in the hall.\n",
      "ROSS Come on.\n",
      "CHANDLER Why, it's six tickets to Hootie and the Blowfish! The Blowfish!\n",
      "MONICA It's on us, all right, so don't worry. It's our treat.\n",
      "PHOEBE So...Thank you.\n",
      "ROSS Could you be less enthused?\n",

      "JOEY Charity.\n",
      "MONICA Charity?\n",
      "ROSS We're just tryin' to do a nice thing here.\n",
      "RACHEL Ross, you have to understand that your nice thing makes us feel this big.\n",
      "PHOEBE Actually, it makes us feel that big.\n",
      "ROSS I don't, I don't understand. I mean, you, it's like we can't win with you guys.\n",
      "CHANDLER If you guys feel this big, maybe that's not our fault. Maybe that's just how you feel.\n",
      "JOEY Oh, now you're tellin' us how you feel.\n",
      "RACHEL Ok, we never shoulda talked about this.\n",
      "PHOEBE I'm just gonna pass on the concert, 'cause I'm just not in a very Hootie place right now.\n",
      "RACHEL Me neither.\n",
      "JOEY Me too.\n",
      "MONICA Guys, we bought the tickets.\n",
      "PHOEBE Oh, well, then you'll have extra seats, you know, for all your tiaras and stuff.\n",
      "CHANDLER Why did you look at me when you said that?\n",
      "MONICA Well, I guess now we can't go.\n",
      "RACHEL What? Come on, you do what you want to do. Do we always have to do everything together?\n",
      "MONICA You know what? You're right.\n",

      "ROSS Geez! Are you ready?\n",
      "CHANDLER Yeah. Just let me grab my jacket and tell you I had sex today.\n",
      "ROSS Whoa! You had sex today?\n",
      "CHANDLER Wow, it sounds even cooler when somebody else says it. I was awesome, ok? She was biting her lip to stop from screaming.\n",
      "ROSS Wow.\n",
      "CHANDLER Now I know it's been awhile, but I took it as a good sign.\n",
      "ROSS Still doing the screening thing?\n",

      "JADE Eh.\n",
      "CHANDLER Eh?\n",
      "JADE Oh, Bob, he was nothing compared to you. I had to bite my lip to keep from screaming your name.\n",
      "CHANDLER Well, that makes me feel so good.\n",
      "JADE It was just so awkward and bumpy.\n",
      "ROSS (silently mouthing) Bumpy?\n",
      "CHANDLER Well, maybe he had some kind of uh, new, cool style, that you're not familiar with. And uh maybe you have to get used to it.\n",
      "JADE Well there really wasn't much time to get used to it, you know what I mean?\n",
      "MONICA You know what? I'm not gonna be able to enjoy this.\n",
      "ROSS Yeah, I know, it's my birthday. We all should be here.\n",
      "CHANDLER So, let's go.\n",
      "ROSS Well maybe, you know, maybe we should stay for one song.\n",
      "CHANDLER Yeah, I mean, it would be rude to them for us to leave now.\n",
      "MONICA You know, the guys are probably having a great time.\n",
      "JOEY Come on you guys, one more time.\n",
      "PHOEBE Ok. One.\n",

      "CHANDLER Yeah, we really missed you guys.\n",
      "JOEY Yeah, look, we were just saying, this whole thing is really stupid.\n",
      "PHOEBE We just have to really, really, really, not let stuff like money get--is that a hickey?\n",
      "MONICA No, I just, I fell down.\n",
      "RACHEL On someone's lips? Where'd you get the hickey?\n",
      "MONICA You know, a party, or--\n",
      "RACHEL What party?\n",
      "ROSS It wasn't so much a party as...a gathering of people, with food, and music, and, and the band.\n",
      "JOEY You partied with Hootie and the Blowfish?\n",
      "CHANDLER Yes, apparently Stevie and the band are like this.\n",
      "RACHEL Who gave you that hickey?\n",
      "MONICA That would be the work of a Blowfish.\n",
      "RACHEL Oh!\n",
      "PHOEBE Oh! I can't believe it. I can't believe this. We're just like, sitting at home, trying to guess Joey's fingers, and you guys are out like partying and having fun, and you know, all, \"hey, Blowfish, suck on my neck\".\n",
      "ROSS Look, don't blame us. You guys coulda been there, you know.\n",
      "RACHEL What, as part of your poor friends outreach program?\n",
      "MONICA It's work.\n",
      "CHANDLER I don't know what to say. I'm sorry that we make more money than you. But we're not gonna feel guilty about it. We work really hard for it.\n",
      "JOEY And we don't work hard?\n",
      "MONICA (on phone) Yeah, hi, it's Monica. I just got a page.\n",
      "CHANDLER I'm just saying that sometimes we like to do stuff that costs a little more.\n",

      "RACHEL Oh!\n",
      "CHANDLER No.\n",
      "MONICA Leon, Leon. Shhh! Guys. Wait, I don't understand. Those steaks were just a gift from the meat vendor. That was not a kick back. I'll just replace them and we can forget the whole thing. What corporate policy? No. Yeah. All right. I just got fired.\n",
      "PHOEBE Oh.\n",

      "Joey We can't, alright? (To the women) We're sorry. You have no idea how sorry, but... We promised we'd find this monkey. If you see him, he's about yea high and answers to the name Marcel, so if we could get some pictures of you, you'd really be helping us out.\n",

      "Rachel Ross, I said I'm sorry like a million times. What do you want me to do? You want me to break my foot too? Okay, I'm gonna break my foot, right here. (Kicks the sign) Ow!! Oh! Oh my God, oh my God! There, are you happy now?!\n",

      "Rachel Y'know, it is not like I did this on purpose.\n",
      "Ross Oh, no no no. Nono, this is just vintage Rachel. I mean, things just sort of happen around you. I mean, you're off in Rachel-land, doing your Rachel-thing, totally oblivious to people's monkeys, or to people's feelings...\n",
      "Rachel Ross.\n",

      "Ross Okay, gimme my monkey back.\n",
      "Mr. Heckles That's my monkey.\n",
      "Luisa You're both gonna have to take this up with the judge.\n",
      "Mr. Heckles That's not my monkey. Just the dress is mine, you can send that back whenever.\n",

      "Luisa No!\n",
      "Rachel Oh, c'mon, Luisa!\n",
      "Luisa Sorry, prom queen.\n",
      "Ross (To Rachel) You had to be a bitch in high school, you couldn't've been fat.\n",
      "Rachel Alright. In high school I was the prom queen and I was the homecoming queen and the class president and you... were also there! But if you take this monkey, I will lose one of the most important people in my life. You can hate me if you want, but please do not punish him. C'mon, Luisa, you have a chance to be the bigger person here! Take it!\n",
      "Luisa Nope.\n",
      "Rachel Alright. Well then how about I call your supervisor, and I tell her that you shot my friend in the ass with a dart?\n",
      "Ross It'll be nice to get this off finally, won't it? Yes it will. (Marcel resists) Or we can leave it on for now, that's fine.\n",
      "Rachel Y'know, with the right pair of pumps, that would be a great little outfit.\n",

      "Rachel That'd be good.\n",
      "Ross Alright. (He goes to get the glasses. Then he hesitates and turns off the main light. Rachel looks round and he acts surprised) The, uh, the neighbours must be vacuuming. (He sits down and starts to pour the wine) Well, so long as we're here and, uh, not on the subject, I was thinking about, uh, how mad we got at each other before, and, um, I was thinking maybe it was partially because of how we, um...\n",

      "Monica No, it doesn't, does it? But you wanted lumps, Ross? (picks up the pan of badly burnt potatoes) Well, here you go, buddy, ya got one.\n",
      "Rachel Oh, god, this is great! The plane is gone, so it looks like I'm stuck here with you guys.\n",
      "Joey Hey, we all had better plans. This was nobody's first choice.\n",
      "Monica Oh, really? So why was I busting my ass to make this delicious Thanksgiving dinner?\n",
      "Joey You call that delicious?\n",
      "Monica Stop it, stop it, stop it!\n",
      "Chandler Now this feels like Thanksgiving.\n",
      "Phoebe Ooh.\n",
      "Rachel What?\n",
      "Phoebe Ugly Naked Guy's taking his turkey out of the oven. Oh my god. He's not alone. Ugly Naked Guy's having Thanksgiving dinner with Ugly Naked Gal.\n",
      "Joey I've gotta see this. All right Ugly Naked Guy!\n",
      "Monica Ooh, Ugly Naked Dancing!\n",
      "Phoebe It's nice that he has someone.\n",
      "Chandler Shall I carve?\n",
      "Rachel By all means.\n",
      "Chandler Ok, who wants light cheese, and who wants dark cheese?\n",
      "Ross I don't even wanna know about the dark cheese.\n",
      "Monica (holding sandwich) Does anybody wanna split this with me?\n",
      "Joey Oh, I will.\n",
      "Phoebe Ooh, you guys have to make a wish.\n",
      "Monica Make a wish?\n",
      "Phoebe Come on, you know, Thanksgiving. Ooh, you got the bigger half. What'd you wish for?\n",
      "Joey The bigger half.\n",
      "Chandler I'd like to propose a toast. Little toast here, ding ding. I know this isn't the kind of Thanksgiving that all of you all planned, but for me, this has been really great, you know, I think because it didn't involve divorce or projectile vomiting. Anyway, I was just thinking, I mean, if you'd gone to Vail, and if you guys'd been with your family, if you didn't have syphilis and stuff, we wouldn't be all together, you know? So I guess what I'm trying to say is that I'm very thankful that all of your Thanksgivings sucked.\n",
      "All That's so sweet.\n",
      "Ross And hey, here's to a lousy Christmas.\n",
      "Rachel And a crappy New Year.\n",

      "Monica Well, I just lost my erection.\n",
      "Chandler I mean, what am I supposed to do with myself?\n",
      "Monica You're supposed to find your passion in life. You can be whatever you wanna be now. It's exciting.\n",
      "Chandler But it's all so overwhelming. I don't know where to start.\n",
      "Monica Hey, wait a second. I can help you with this. You just need to be organized. We can make a list of your qualifications, and categorize jobs by industry. There could be folders and files!\n",
      "Chandler Hey! This is where your hyper-organized-pain-in-the-ass stuff pays off!\n",

      "Phoebe I'm sorry, it's just, I'm a little short on cash.\n",
      "Joey If you want I could loan you some money?\n",
      "Phoebe Oh no, no, no. I learned never to borrow money from friends. No, that's why Richard Dreyfuss and I don't speak anymore.\n",
      "Joey Oh, hey, how about this? Wanna be an extra on my show?\n",
      "Phoebe You could do that?\n",
      "Joey Yeah, yeah. The pay is pretty good and you could do it for as long as you need.\n",
      "Phoebe Oh my god, I'm gonna be on TV!\n",
      "Joey Okay, now. I gotta tell you, being on TV isn't as glamorous and exciting as you think.\n",

      "Ross Rachel and I are bringing Emma to Ralph Lauren today to introduce her to everyone. Doesn't she look cute?\n",
      "Joey She sure does. Why does she have a pink bow taped to her head?\n",
      "Rachel Well, because if one more person says \"what a cute little boy\" I'm gonna whip them with a car antenna!\n",
      "Ross I think she's gonna be the hit of the office, huh? She's gonna be hotter than peasant blouses and A-line skirts. Can I get a blue bow?\n",
      "Monica (Flipping through bunch of folders as Chandler enters from bathroom) Okay, I have looked through a bunch of career guides, photocopied and highlighted key passages and put them into alphabetical folders so you can make an informed decision.\n",
      "Chandler How long was I in there?\n",
      "Monica Okay. Let us start with the A's. Advertising.\n",
      "Chandler Wait. Advertising! That's a great idea!\n",
      "Monica Don't you want to look through the rest?\n",
      "Chandler I don't think I have to hear the rest. Advertising makes perfect sense. Sorry you had to waste all this time, though.\n",
      "Monica You call eight hours alone with my label maker wasted time? Ooh, now I get to use my shredder!\n",
      "Chandler I mean, I can write slogans. I mean, how hard can it be, right? \"Cheese. It's milk that you chew.\" \"Crackers. Because your cheese needs a buddy.\" \"A grape. Because who can get a water melon in your mouth?\"\n",
      "Monica I got one. \"Socks. Because your family's feet deserve the best.\"\n",
      "Chandler Honey? Leave it to the pros.\n",
      "Monica I actually know someone in advertising. I grew up with this guy who is a vice president at a big agency. Maybe I can get him to meet you? Give me the phone.\n",
      "Chandler \"The phone. Bringing you closer to people...who have phones.\"\n",
      "Monica \"Marriage. It's not for everybody.\"\n",
      "Rachel That went well. Almost everybody knew that she was a girl.\n",
      "Ross Yeah, after you punched that one guy who got it wrong, word spread.\n",
      "Rachel I'm just gonna go in my office and pick up some stuff . (To the guy behind her desk) Who the hell are you!?\n",
      "Guy Who the hell are you?\n",
      "Rachel I'm the hell person whose office this is!\n",
      "Ross Good one, Rach.\n",
      "Guy I'm Gavin Mitchell, the person who's taken over your job.\n",
      "Rachel Excuse me?\n",
      "Gavin Oh, your baby's so cute. Why did you put a pink bow on a boy?\n",
      "Phoebe Joey, look at me! I'm a nurse!\n",
      "Joey Yes you are. I think it may be time for my sponge bath. Sorry, I'm just so used to hitting on the extras. So, are you excited about your scene?\n",
      "Phoebe Yeah! But I'm a little shaky and nervous.\n",
      "Joey Oh, relax. Don't be. You'll be fine, you'll be fine. They'll probably just make you stand in the back.\n",
      "Director Okay, okay, okay! (To Phoebe) You. Here, come here, here. You're gonna take this tray, you're gonna stay on this yellow mark. You're gonna move on \"action!\" You're gonna walk over to the operating table. You're gonna stop on that blue mark, you're gonna put the tray down. Don't walk too fast! But don't doddle.\n",

      "Director And...Action!!\n",
      "Director Cut! Cut!\n",

      "Director And...Action!\n",
      "Interviewer So, do you have any other question about advertising?\n",
      "Chandler No, no. But let me show you what I can do. \"Bagels and donuts. Round food for every mood.\"\n",
      "Interviewer Monica warned me you might do that. I actually think we might have something for you at the agency.\n",
      "Chandler Really? That's great!\n",
      "Interviewer It's an unpaid internship.\n",
      "Chandler It's funny. When you said \"unpaid\" it sounded like you said \"unpaid.\"\n",
      "Interviewer Come on now. Monica has a good job. And it's not like you have a family to support.\n",
      "Chandler Actually, we're trying, and I don't think Monica's gonna wanna postpone it. We're supposed to have sex tonight. Actually, she's probably at home naked right now. I tend to keep talking until somebody stops me. I can just picture her on the bed right now.\n",
      "Interviewer Stop!\n",
      "Interviewer Okay.\n",
      "Rachel Wait a minute! What do you mean, you're taking over my job?\n",
      "Gavin Well, while you were on your baby vacation I was doing your job.\n",
      "Rachel A vacation? My idea of a vacation does not involve something sucking on my nipples until they are raw.\n",
      "Gavin Clearly you've never been to Sandles Paradise Island.\n",
      "Rachel Alright! Don't get too comfortable there, because I'm back in two weeks! And I want everything back to the way it was. I can't say that I care too much for the way you've rearranged my office.\n",
      "Gavin I can't say I care too much for that smell you've brought in with you.\n",
      "Rachel Excuse me?\n",
      "Ross Rach we have a code brown situation.\n",
      "Rachel Can you please, please take care of it for me?\n",
      "Ross Alright, but you have to do one sometime.\n",
      "Rachel Let me just get this straight! So I go have a baby and they send some guy in to do my job?\n",
      "Gavin Well, there was talk of shutting down Ralph Lauren all together.\n",
      "Rachel That's right. You're very cheeky for a temp.\n",
      "Gavin I'm not a temp. I was transferred here from another department.\n",
      "Rachel Oh yeah, what department was that? The Jerk department?\n",
      "Gavin Oh, they didn't tell me about your quick wit.\n",
      "Rachel Did they mention that I'm rubber and you're glue?\n",
      "Mr. Zelner (Enters) Gavin, Ralph loved your ideas.\n",
      "Rachel Oh, hi Mr. Zelner.\n",
      "Mr. Zelner Rachel, I see you've met Gavin. I must say, when you left us we weren't sure what we were gonna do. But then, Gavin to the rescue. Super Gavin!\n",
      "Rachel That's great. So now, Super Gavin, when I come back where are you planning on flying off to?\n",
      "Gavin Well, that's up to Mr. Zelner. I'm sure he will make the right decision.\n",
      "Rachel (To herself) Oh, wow. Super ass-kissing power.\n",
      "Mr. Zelner Incidentally, when are you coming back?\n",
      "Rachel Today.\n",
      "Gavin You said two weeks.\n",
      "Rachel No, I said today! See, for a superhero, not so much with the listening.\n",
      "Joey Hey.\n",
      "Phoebe Hey. So, what did he say?\n",
      "Joey Well, he can be a little rough around the edges, so I'm gonna replace a word he used a lot, with the word \"puppy.\" Okay, so he said: \"If your puppy friend doesn't get her puppy act together, I'm gonna fire her mother-puppy ass.\"\n",
      "Phoebe I'm sorry, I can't do this. I'm not an actor.\n",
      "Joey That's right, you're not. You're a nurse. You're Nurse With Tray.\n",
      "Phoebe Joey.\n",
      "Joey No, no. Nurse With Tray doesn't know Joey, she doesn't have time for friends. She gets in that operating room and she carries that tray to the doctor, because if she doesn't, people die!\n",
      "Phoebe Who dies?\n",
      "Joey (Points to man on operating table) Man With Eye Patch! You get in there and you do your job.\n",
      "Phoebe Yes, doctor.\n",
      "Joey Okay.\n",
      "Director Okay, let's try this one more time.\n",
      "Phoebe Hang in there, Man With Eye Patch, your tray is coming!\n",
      "Director And...Action!\n",
      "Phoebe (Does the scene) Yes, I did it!!! I nailed it!!! Yay! What's next?\n",
      "Director The rest of the scene.\n",
      "Phoebe Okay, from the top, people!\n",
      "Rachel Listen. Sudden change of plans. My maternity leave just ended. They told me that if I didn't come back today, they were gonna fire me.\n",
      "Ross What? No, that's illegal. I'm gonna have the labor department down her so fast they won't even...\n",
      "Rachel Alright, alright. Calm down Norma Rae. They didn't actually say that. I'm just afraid if I don't come back right now this guy's gonna try to squeeze me out.\n",
      "Ross What about Emma? We don't have a nanny.\n",
      "Rachel I know. You know, we're just gonna have to figure out a plan tonight. Can you please just take care of her for today?\n",
      "Ross Absolutely. Just give me your breast and we'll be on our way.\n",
      "Rachel Come on, I don't know what else to do.\n",
      "Ross Fine, fine. (To Emma) We'll have fun, won't we? Yes, we will, yes we will. (Gives her a kiss, and the pink bow tapes itself to his head.)\n",
      "Rachel Ross?\n",
      "Ross Huh?\n",
      "Rachel You're pretty.\n",
      "Chandler Whatever I decide to do, I'm gonna be starting a career from scratch. It's gonna be a while before I make a living at it. Maybe now is not the right time to be starting a family.\n",
      "Ross So you have to tell Monica you don't want to have a baby right now?\n",
      "Chandler Yeah.\n",
      "Ross (Hugs Chandler) Good-bye.\n",
      "Monica (Enters) Okay, it's baby time. Pants off Bing. (Sees Ross) Didn't see you there Geller.\n",
      "Chandler Yeah, Ross is here so...\n",
      "Ross Yeah, and I was really hoping that I could hang out. What do you feel like doing?\n",
      "Monica We're gonna have sex.\n",
      "Ross I don't feel like having sex. Maybe we can watch a movie or something.\n",
      "Monica Let me put it this way. We're having sex whether you're here or not.\n",
      "Ross Pants off Bing!\n",
      "Rachel Alright. Now that I'm back, why don't you just fill me in on what you've been up to?\n",
      "Gavin Well, I've changed your screensaver from that picture of *Nsync.\n",
      "Rachel Hey, they were popular when I left!\n",
      "Gavin Also, I've just been working on this big presentation for tomorrow.\n",
      "Rachel Well, I should be involved in that, so why don't you get me up to speed?\n",
      "Gavin That's gonna take weeks. Why don't just let me take care of the presentation?\n",
      "Rachel Oh, no no no no. I see what you're doing here, alright, listen, this is my job buddy. Okay, I've had it for five years, and I know how it works, so why don't you just catch me up!\n",
      "Gavin Fine.\n",
      "Rachel (Sits down in her chair) Oh god. You've totally messed with the back support of my chair. How do you fix this?\n",
      "Gavin Hey, you've been here five years, you figure it out.\n",
      "Rachel Fine, I will. (Pushes that button thing on the chair that makes it \"collapse\") Alright, fill me in!\n",
      "Ross Hey.\n",
      "Chandler Hey.\n",
      "Ross You have a blue tie that would go with this? Emma spit up on mine.\n",
      "Chandler Oh, yeah. But you have to give it back if I get a job. Of course, by that time in the future ties will be obsolete and we'll all be wearing silver jump suits.\n",
      "Monica (Enters from the bedroom) Hi, good morning lover. I gotta say after last night, I'm a little weak in the knees.\n",
      "Ross Here's an idea. You walk into a room...take a quick scan!\n",
      "Monica (To Ross) Sorry. (To Chandler) But I kind of have this feeling that we may have made a baby last night.\n",
      "Chandler Oh god, I have to tell you something. You're not pregnant.\n",
      "Monica What are you talking about?\n",
      "Chandler That thing that I have to do to make a baby. I faked it.\n",
      "Monica What!? You faked it?\n",
      "Ross You know what? I don't need a tie. I mean, it's better, open collar. You know, it's more casual (He leaves.)\n",
      "Phoebe Joey, listen. I can't do this, it doesn't make any sense. Yesterday I was a nurse, and today I'm a waitress at a cafe?\n",
      "Joey Oh, sometimes we use the same extras for different parts. It's okay.\n",
      "Phoebe Well, it's not okay, because I gave a very memorable performance as the nurse. And now suddenly I'm the waitress? That's gonna confuse my fans.\n",
      "Joey Maybe you are a nurse, but you moonlight as a waitress.\n",
      "Phoebe Uhuh. Because I'm a single mother, supporting my two children.\n",
      "Joey Nice.\n",
      "Phoebe Wait a minute. Dr. Drake Ramoray and I work at the same hospital. Wouldn't I come over to say hi to him?\n",
      "Joey No, no. See, you and Drake are having a fight.\n",
      "Phoebe About what?\n",
      "Joey He slept with you and then never called you.\n",
      "Phoebe And I just wanted a new daddy for Davy and Becky.\n",
      "Director Okay, okay, from the top. And...Action!\n",
      "Man So, I'm surprised you agreed to have lunch with me.\n",
      "Joey/Drake I'm surprised to, but yet here I am.\n",
      "Director Cut, cut! What are you doing!?\n",
      "Phoebe Yeah, well, I'm very angry at him, because he slept with me and never called me back.\n",
      "Extra Me too!\n",
      "Another extra Me too!\n",
      "Joey Oh, calm down! She means on the show! We need some new extras around here!\n",
      "Gavin (Enters) Wow, you're here already.\n",
      "Rachel Yes. Emma and I came in a little early to do research on the presentation. I actually made a few changes, but I think I'm caught up on everything. So ask me anything!\n",
      "Gavin How do you fix the chair?\n",
      "Rachel Except that! (Mr. Zelner enters) Oh, hello, Mr. Zelner. We're all ready for our presentation this afternoon.\n",
      "Mr. Zelner Good, because it's in ten minutes.\n",
      "Rachel What? I can't do that! I have the baby, and Ross is not gonna pick her up for another hour.\n",
      "Mr. Zelner Well, then Gavin can give the presentation, okay, we have to do it now. Ralph needs to leave early today. He's going helicopter shopping.\n",
      "Rachel Well, there you go. You win, you win. You get to do the presentation, you'll knock 'em dead, no one will ever remember that I worked here, and then Ralph will buy his helicopter, and Super Gavin will just fly right along side of him!\n",
      "Gavin You can do the presentation.\n",
      "Rachel No, I can't, I have a baby.\n",
      "Gavin I'll watch her.\n",
      "Rachel Why would you do that?\n",
      "Gavin Because you've worked really hard, and it's your job, and you're a little crazy.\n",
      "Rachel That's really nice.\n",
      "Gavin I should tell you that crying women make me very uncomfortable.\n",
      "Rachel Then you're not gonna like what's coming. (Starts crying) I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry. Thank you, thank you.\n",
      "Gavin I'm really fine, don't worry, I'm great with children. (To Emma) Gavin Mitchell. Pleased to meet you.\n",
      "Joey Please don't fire my friend. Just let me talk to her.\n",
      "Director Okay, okay. But this is her last chance.\n",
      "Joey Thank you, thank you. How about I do something for you? Tomorrow, I'll bring you a hat, cover up the bald?\n",
      "Joey Hey, listen Pheebs. I was just talking to the director, and he was thinking, maybe this time you don't hit Drake, you just wait on the tables?\n",
      "Phoebe I can't do that. I'm an actor. I have a process.\n",
      "Joey You're a masseuse. You have a table with a hole in it.\n",
      "Phoebe Wait a minute, I see what's happening here. You're threatened.\n",
      "Joey What?\n",
      "Phoebe Yeah, I'm so good in this scene that I'm stealing focus from you. Well, rise to the challenge Tribianni 'cause I just raised the bar. Come join me up here!\n",
      "Joey (To the director) Yeah, you can fire her, but I would call security, she won't go easy.\n",
      "Monica You faked it? You couldn't have faked it!\n",
      "Chandler Oh yes you can. You just make the faces and the noises.\n",
      "Monica Guys can fake it? Unbelievable. The one thing that's ours! Besides, why would you fake it when we're trying to have a baby?\n",
      "Chandler That's actually why. Look, I'm starting a whole new career now, and I'm not saying that I don't want to have a baby, I'm just saying maybe we could wait a little while.\n",
      "Monica Like a month?\n",
      "Chandler Or a year?\n",
      "Monica Really, you want to wait a year?\n",
      "Chandler It could be less than a year. I mean, you've heard my stuff. \"Pants. Like shorts, but longer.\" (Pause) It'll probably be more than a year.\n",
      "Monica I really wanna have a baby.\n",
      "Chandler Yeah, me too. Look, I'll just get my old job back.\n",
      "Monica No, I want you to have a job that you love. Not statistical analysis and data reconfiguration.\n",
      "Chandler I quit and you learn what I do?\n",
      "Monica It's just, I think, there's never gonna be a right time to have a baby. I mean, now you're unemployed and in a little while you'll find a new job that'll keep you really busy. There's always gonna be a reason not to do this, but I think once the baby comes, forget about all those reasons.\n",
      "Chandler I guess. It's always gonna be scary when we have a baby.\n",
      "Monica It's gonna be really scary. I mean, god. When we have a baby, there's gonna be so much that we're not able to control. I mean, the apartment's gonna be a mess, I won't have time to clean it. What if the baby gets into the ribbon drawer? Messes up all the ribbons?! What if there's no room for a ribbon drawer, because the baby's stuff takes up all the space!? Where will all the ribbons go!?!\n",
      "Chandler Should we go make a baby right now before you change your mind?\n",
      "Monica Yes, please!\n",
      "Chandler Oh, and I promise, I will not fake it this time.\n",
      "Monica I wish I could say the same. I'm a little shook up!\n",
      "Joey/Drake I know you botched that operation on purpose. I can't prove it yet, but when I do, you'll be going to jail for murder. I don't care if you are my brother.\n",
      "Man I'm not your brother.\n",
      "Phoebe/Waitress What about my children Drake?! Huh!? (She starts running around on the set with a security guy chasing her) No!! No!! No! God!\n",

      "Ross Uh Joey, can you give us just a minute?\n",
      "Joey No.\n",
      "Ross What?\n",
      "Joey Oh, I’m sorry. I meant no.\n",
      "Monica (entering with everyone else including Mr. Geller) Hi! Hey look who’s here!\n",
      "Mr. Geller Where’s my granddaughter? I’ve been practicing my magic tricks.\n",
      "Chandler He pulled a quarter out of my ear!\n",
      "Ross Hey, where’s uh, where’s mom?\n",
      "Mr. Geller She went to pick up Aunt Liddy.\n",
      "Monica Oh, Aunt Liddy’s coming? That means we get five dollars each!\n",
      "Mr. Geller So when do I get to meet Emma and show her this? (Pulls a bouquet of flowers out of his sleeve.)\n",
      "Chandler Okay. Wow.\n",
      "Ross Uh Dad, Emma’s in the nursery. I’ll take you now. If you want, but (To Rachel) I really want to talk to you.\n",
      "Rachel I know, I still need to talk to you.\n",
      "Joey Oh hey but, before you guys do that (To Rachel) I need to talk to you, and Ross, I need to talk to you.\n",
      "Phoebe (To Monica) Oh and I need to talk to you.\n",
      "Monica About what?\n",
      "Phoebe To see if know what these guys are talking about.\n",
      "Monica Isn’t she beautiful?\n",
      "Mr. Geller Look at her, my first grandchild.\n",
      "Ross What about Ben?\n",
      "Mr. Geller Well of course Ben, I meant my first granddaughter. (To Monica, mouths) Wow.\n",
      "Phoebe (taking Ross aside) Have umm, have you thought anymore about you and Rachel?\n",
      "Ross Oh well yeah, actually I was going to talk to her when you guys all came in the room.\n",
      "Phoebe Yay! It’s so exciting! Wow, you could’ve done that with us there.\n",
      "Ross Yeah right.\n",
      "Phoebe Oh sure okay, you can touch yourself in front of us but you can’t talk to Rachel.\n",
      "Ross What?! When have I ever touched myself in front of you guys?\n",
      "Phoebe Oh please! Just before when you were asleep in the lounge! That Armenian family was watching you instead of the TV. Oh, that reminds me. That Mr. Hasmeje still has my Gameboy.\n",
      "Joey (taking Chandler aside) Hey Chandler, can I talk to you for a second?\n",
      "Chandler Sure.\n",
      "Joey Dude I just did something terrible.\n",
      "Chandler That was you?! I thought it was Jack!\n",
      "Joey No! No, that was Jack! Rachel thinks I asked her to marry me!\n",
      "Chandler What?! Why does she think that?\n",
      "Joey Because it kinda looked like I did.\n",
      "Chandler Again, what?!\n",
      "Joey Okay well, I was down on one knee with the ring in my hand…\n",
      "Chandler As we all are at some point during the day.\n",
      "Joey It wasn’t my ring! It fell out of Ross’s jacket! And when I knelt down to pick it up Rachel thought I was proposing!\n",
      "Chandler Ross had a ring?! And he was gonna propose?\n",
      "Joey I guess.\n",
      "Chandler And you did it first?! This is gonna kill him! You know how much he loves to propose!\n",
      "Joey I know! I know it’s awful.\n",
      "Chandler Well, what did she say?\n",
      "Joey (happily) She said yes.\n",
      "Chandler Does Ross know?\n",
      "Joey Oh God, what the hell am I going to tell him?\n",
      "Chandler Well maybe you don’t have to tell him anything.\n",
      "Joey Oh, I like that. Yeah…\n",
      "Chandler If you clear things up with Rachel then Ross never needs to find out, but you have to do it now before he hears about it and kicks your ass!\n",
      "Joey (laughs) Now let’s not get carried away. (He walks away as Monica comes over and hugs Chandler from behind.)\n",
      "Monica I want a baby.\n",
      "Chandler Honey, we’ve been over this. I need to be facing the other way.\n",
      "Monica Come on! Come on, if we have sex again it’ll double our chances of getting pregnant. Do you think that closet’s still available?\n",
      "Chandler I’m so tired. (She starts kissing him.) Yeah okay, but no foreplay.\n",
      "Monica Deal!\n",
      "Ross Dad seriously! Y’know you really should see someone about that!\n",
      "Mr. Geller Noted.\n",
      "Ross I wanna go talk to Rachel for a minute, are you gonna be okay alone for a bit?\n",
      "Mr. Geller Are you kidding me, I could stay and look at her forever.\n",
      "Ross (noticing something) Actually umm… (He turns Mr. Geller’s head to look at Emma.)\n",
      "Phoebe Hey!\n",
      "Rachel Hi.\n",
      "Phoebe Are you all right?\n",
      "Rachel Uhh… I think I just got engaged.\n",
      "Phoebe Oh my God! He did it?\n",
      "Rachel Well…did you know he was gonna ask me?\n",
      "Phoebe Are you kidding? I’m like the one who talked him into it. I like to think of myself as the puppet master of the group.\n",
      "Rachel And you really think this is a good idea?\n",
      "Phoebe I just talked him into it, don’t tell me I have to do you too. The puppet master gets tired people.\n",
      "Rachel I just don’t know! It just doesn’t feel right.\n",
      "Phoebe Why?! You two are so meant to be together, everybody thinks so.\n",
      "Rachel Really?! Even Ross?\n",
      "Phoebe Especially Ross!\n",
      "Joey (entering) Oh uh, hey Pheebs. Uh y’know what? I’ll-I’ll come back later. (He goes to leave but runs into Ross who’s entering.)\n",
      "Ross Wow! Kind of uh, kind of a full house here. I’ll guess just…I’ll come back. (Ross exits followed by Joey.)\n",
      "Phoebe There he goes, your fianc�e.\n",
      "Rachel I guess so.\n",
      "Phoebe Although he does play with himself in his sleep.\n",
      "Rachel I can’t say that I’m surprised.\n",
      "Ross Dad, what are you doing?\n",
      "Mr. Geller I think there are people in there having sex.\n",
      "Joey It can’t be me, I’m standing right here.\n",
      "Mr. Geller Wanna peek?\n",
      "Ross No!\n",
      "Mr. Geller Come on!\n",
      "Ross Y’know what? I don’t like you without mom. (To Joey) Come on. (Walks away.)\n",
      "Joey (To Ross) We’re not peeking? (Follows him.)\n",
      "Mr. Geller Well I’m peeking. (He peeks.) Oh my God!\n",
      "Chandler Hello sir, you know Monica.\n",
      "Joey Hey uh, is it okay to come in?\n",
      "Rachel Of course! Oh Joey, this ring I…it’s beautiful I love it!\n",
      "Joey Yeah uh look Rach, there’s something I gotta tell ya.\n",
      "Rachel Hey!\n",
      "Nurse Hey! Are you ready to try nursing again?\n",
      "Rachel Yeah! Hi Emma. Hey, why do you think she won’t take my breast?\n",
      "Nurse It’s all right honey, it takes some babies a while to get it, but don’t worry. It’ll happen.\n",
      "Joey (watching) Yowsa! (Looks away.)\n",
      "Rachel Okay sweetie, you can do it. Just open up and put it in your mouth.\n",
      "Joey Dear Lord.\n",
      "Rachel I’m sorry honey, what were you saying?\n",
      "Joey Oh uh-uh yeah, I think that…\n",
      "Rachel Oh look, she’s pulling away again! Do you think my nipples are too big for her mouth? (Joey gets embarrassed.) She looks scared. Doesn’t she look scared?\n",
      "Joey Y’know, I don’t really know her.\n",
      "Nurse Why don’t we try massaging the breast to stimulate the flow. (Does so.)\n",
      "Joey (To God) Are you kidding me?!\n",
      "Rachel It’s just so frustrating! Why doesn’t she want my breast?!\n",
      "Joey I don’t know! Maybe she’s crazy! (Storms out.)\n",
      "Phoebe Oh hey! Wait up!\n",
      "Ross Hi!\n",
      "Phoebe Congratulations! I didn’t want to say anything in front of Joey ‘cause I didn’t know if he knew yet.\n",
      "Ross What, that we had a baby? Come on let’s give him a little credit, although, he did eat a piece of plastic fruit earlier.\n",
      "Phoebe No! No, that you and Rachel are engaged!\n",
      "Ross What?\n",
      "Phoebe Oh, it’s a secret. Oh goodie! Yes! We haven’t done the secret thing in a long time.\n",
      "Ross Phoebe, there is no secret. Okay? I didn’t propose.\n",
      "Phoebe Are you lying? Is this like that time you tried to convince us that you were a doctor?\n",
      "Ross (pause) I am a doctor! Y’know what? I’m just gonna go and talk to Rachel myself.\n",
      "Phoebe All right, me too. (They go into her room and see that she’s sleeping.) Should we wake her up?\n",
      "Ross No! No, come on let her sleep! She’s so exhausted.\n",
      "Phoebe And so engaged. (Points to the ring that Rachel is wearing.)\n",
      "Ross What? (Motions for Phoebe to go outside with him.) Oh my God! She-she thinks we’re engaged! Why? Why? Why would she think we’re engaged?!\n",
      "Phoebe Perhaps because you gave her an engagement ring? Y’know Ross doctors are supposed to be smart.\n",
      "Ross I didn’t give her that ring!\n",
      "Phoebe Really?\n",
      "Ross No!\n",
      "Phoebe So whose ring is it?\n",
      "Ross It’s mine.\n",

      "Phoebe Oh, what beautiful lukewarm sentiment.\n",
      "Ross Look, I didn’t want to rush into anything. And it seemed like she didn’t want to either. But I don’t, I don’t understand how any of this happened! What? Did she find the ring in my jacket, assume that I was going to propose, throw it on, and-and just start telling people?\n",
      "Phoebe No! No, she said you actually proposed to her.\n",
      "Ross Well I didn’t! I didn’t propose! (Pause) Unless uh… (Pause) Did I? I haven’t slept in forty hours and…it does sound like something I would do.\n",

      "Chandler This is okay. We’re all adults here; there’s nothing to be ashamed of. Now, let’s put our underwear in our pockets and walk out the door. (They do so and find Mr. Geller leaning against a wall stunned.)\n",

      "Mr. Geller Oh, I don’t think that. Before today I never thought of you two having sex at all. It was a simpler time.\n",

      "Mr. Geller Whoa-whoa-whoa! I don’t think so! Aren’t you ovulating?\n",
      "Monica Daddy?!\n",
      "Mr. Geller Well you gotta get at it princess! When your mother and I were trying to conceive you, whenever she was ovulating, bam, we did it. That’s how I got my bad hip.\n",
      "Chandler That’s funny, this conversation’s how I got the bullet hole in my head.\n",
      "Mr. Geller This one time I had my knee up on the sink and your mother, she was…\n",

      "Monica Who cares? He works in a museum!\n",
      "Chandler Hey, what time is it? The big game is about to start!\n",
      "Phoebe You don’t have to do that, Ross and Joey aren’t here, you can watch the parade if you want.\n",
      "Chandler Thanks.\n",
      "Monica What is wrong with this freezer?! (She jabs her arm into the freezer and a piece of ice flies into her eye.) Ow! Ow!!\n",
      "Phoebe God, what happened?!\n",
      "Monica Oh my God, ice just got in my eye!\n",
      "Rachel (standing in her doorway) People are trying to sleep in here!\n",
      "Chandler Monica got ice in her eye, and it hurts.\n",
      "Phoebe Open it up, let me see.\n",
      "Monica Oh, y’know what, I can’t, it really kills.\n",
      "Chandler Well maybe you should put some ice on it.\n",
      "Phoebe Ooh, God it looks bad.\n",
      "Rachel Honey, maybe we should take you to a doctor.\n",
      "Monica No, my eye doctor is Richard! I can’t go to him when I don’t have a boyfriend!\n",
      "Chandler He’s really picky about his patients.\n",
      "Phoebe Honey, you’ve got to go. What’s his office number?\n",
      "Monica Like I remember his office number! (Pause) Speed dial 7.\n",
      "Phoebe (on phone) Hi! Yeah, I’m calling on behalf of Monica Geller’s eye, and is um, is Richard Burke in today. (Listens) (to Monica) He’s out of town, but does she want to see the on-call doctor?\n",
      "Monica Yes!!\n",
      "Phoebe Yes! She’s very excited about that.\n",
      "Phoebe This is so cool, ‘til Monica gets back, it’s like I’m head chef and I get to make all the decisions. (She looks at the remaining butter, and then decides to add it to the dish.)\n",
      "Ross Hey-hey, I thought she told you to follow the recipe exactly!\n",
      "Phoebe Okay, get out of my kitchen!\n",
      "Chandler (entering) All right! Okay! I think I am making some progress with Joey, when I went into the apartment he went straight into his bedroom but he only slammed the door once! (Ross is pleased.) I mean yeah, he gave me the finger while doing it.\n",
      "Phoebe All right I… I gotta call my mom and ask her a left handed cooking question.\n",
      "Ross So listen ah, I picked Monica for secret Santa, but I’m already getting her something for Chanukah, I was wondering if you wanna switch.\n",
      "Chandler Oh y’know what, I was already trying to trade for ah, well, you.\n",
      "Ross Really?! Wow! That’s-that’s so nice, what are you gonna get me?\n",
      "Chandler I don’t know R.G., I was thinking something girlie for your office.\n",
      "Ross Yeah, well maybe Phoebe will switch with me.\n",
      "Chandler Oh no-no-no, you don’t want to do that, then you’re gonna get stuck with Rachel and she exchanges every gift she ever gets.\n",
      "Ross Oh, that’s not true! I’ve got her lots of stuff she never took back.\n",
      "Chandler Like?\n",
      "Ross Like uh, that gold necklace I got her last year.\n",
      "Chandler When was the last time you saw her wear it?\n",
      "Ross Well, she wore it all Christmas day, and then uh…\n",
      "Chandler Big dog?\n",
      "Ross (entering) Hey!\n",
      "Joey Hey!\n",
      "Ross What are you doing?\n",
      "Joey I’m sending back all this stuff that Chandler bought out of guilt.\n",
      "Ross Everything? Even the TV?\n",
      "Joey No! I’m putting that in my room.\n",
      "Ross Listen, Joey, I know what he did was wrong but don’t you think you could at least hear the guy out?\n",
      "Joey Back when you and Rachel were together, if Chandler had kissed her, would you hear him out?\n",
      "Ross That’s a good point. So uh, how long are you gonna punish him?\n",
      "Joey Five years.\n",
      "Ross You’ve sentenced him?!\n",
      "Joey Hey! Don’t do the crime if you can’t do the time.\n",
      "Ross Joey, the guy’s your best friend.\n",
      "Joey No, was my best friend. Anyway, I don’t know why you’re pushing for him so hard. With him out of the way as my best friend, there’s a spot open.\n",
      "Ross Oh, who? Me?\n",
      "Joey Yeah!\n",
      "Ross Wow! I’m honored! And y’know what I’m gonna do as my first act as your best friend?\n",
      "Joey What?\n",
      "Ross I’m gonna get you to talk to Chandler.\n",
      "Joey All right. But if you weren’t my best friend.\n",
      "Kathy Oh my God, is it really that bad?\n",
      "Chandler I walk into a room and he won’t even talk to me, he just mumbles something in Italian. And I know he only knows the bad words.\n",
      "Joey (entering) Hey Gunther, have you uh, have you seen Chandler?\n",
      "Gunther I thought you were Chandler. But umm, one of who is over there.\n",
      "Kathy Oh.\n",
      "Chandler Hey Joe.\n",
      "Joey (Something in Italian.) (Storms out.)\n",
      "Doctor I’ll be right with you. Okay? (to the nurse) Thanks, Wendy.\n",
      "Monica Oh my God! How cute is the on-call doctor?\n",
      "Rachel Ooh, so cute, that I’m thinking about jamming this pen in my eye.\n",
      "Nurse Dr. Burke will see you know.\n",
      "Monica Oh no-no-no, not Dr. Burke. Dr. Burke is out of town. The-the on-call doctor will see me now.\n",
      "Nurse Dr. Richard Burke is out of town. Dr. Timothy Burke, his son, will see you now.\n",
      "Dr. Timothy Burke Ready?\n",
      "Chandler Hey! I’m sorry! That—(sees that Joey is about to leave) where are you going?\n",
      "Joey My folks.\n",
      "Chandler Oh, uh, when-when are you coming back?\n",
      "Joey I don’t know. I might stay there for a few days while I look for an apartment.\n",
      "Chandler What?!\n",
      "Joey Yeah, y’know at first I thought we could talk about this y’know, work it out, but uh, seeing you two together I don’t think I…\n",
      "Chandler Hey, look, what do you want me to say? Do you want me to say that I’ll stop seeing her?\n",
      "Joey Look, it’s not about her. Okay? But seeing you two together just reminds me of what you did. And I don’t want to live with some one who doesn’t know what it is to be a friend. So, I’ll see ya. (He starts to leave, but Chandler grabs his bag and stops him.)\n",
      "Chandler Hey, look, I know what it is to be a friend, I just-I just screwed up!\n",
      "Joey Yeah! You did! And that’s why I’m leaving.\n",
      "Chandler All right look, if you’re not gonna stay for me, then at least stay for them! Okay, they have had a very difficult year! What with the robbery and all!\n",
      "Joey When that guy was robbing us, and I was locked in the entertainment unit for like six hours, you know what I was doing in there all that time? I was thinking about how I let you down!\n",
      "Chandler What?\n",
      "Joey Yeah! But if would’ve know what kind of friend you were gonna turn out to be, I wouldn’t have worried about it so much! See you around!\n",
      "Chandler All right, wait! Come on! Just wait one second! There has to be something that I can do! Something! If we still had that entertainment unit I would get in it for six hours and think about how I let you down. (Joey looks intrigued) What?\n",
      "Joey We’ve got a box. (Motions to a large wooden box next to him.)\n",
      "Tim Last time I saw you, it was the morning I left for college. And you were just standing outside The Dairy Queen.\n",
      "Monica I was probably waiting for it to open.\n",
      "Tim I gotta tell you, you look great now.\n",
      "Monica You look great too.\n",
      "Tim You’re an excellent patient!\n",
      "Monica So how does it look?\n",
      "Tim Well, you’ve got a little scratch on your cornea, your gonna have to wear a patch for a couple of days.\n",
      "Monica Like a pirate?!\n",
      "Tim If that helps you.\n",
      "Monica Umm, so how long have you been working with your dad? (He looks at her) Come on, one of us had to mention him.\n",
      "Tim I moved back here a couple of months ago.\n",
      "Monica Oh. Big family dinner tonight?\n",
      "Tim Uh. (He holds up a brown lunch bag.)\n",
      "Monica No way!\n",
      "Tim I was gonna have Thanksgiving at my girlfriend’s.\n",
      "Monica (disappointed) Oh.\n",
      "Tim But we broke up.\n",
      "Monica (happy) Oh.\n",
      "Tim She-she wasn’t ready for a serious commitment.\n",
      "Monica (sympathetic) Oh. (in a pirate’s voice) So you made her walk the plank? Aye, matie?\n",
      "Tim You’re not wearing the patch yet.\n",
      "Monica I know.\n",
      "Ross He’s coming here for Thanksgiving!\n",
      "Rachel I know, it’s sick.\n",
      "Monica Why is it sick?\n",
      "Rachel Because it’s Richard’s son! It’s like inviting Greek tragedy over for dinner!\n",
      "Monica Hey, come on, Phoebe, you understand don’t you?\n",
      "Phoebe Yeah, I can see where I’d be your best shot but, no. I’m sorry, but I think it’s twisted.\n",
      "Ross Yeah.\n",
      "Joey (coming out of the bathroom) What’s twisted?\n",
      "Monica Me going out with Richard’s son.\n",
      "Joey Ewwwww!! Ew! Ew! Ew!\n",
      "Chandler (He is now in the box, in their living room.) Sounds like a really bad idea to me.\n",
      "Rachel Is he okay in there?\n",
      "Joey He’s fine!\n",
      "Ross Hey, y'know, Mon, if things wrong out between you and Richard’s son, you’d be able to tell your kids, that you slept with their grandfather.\n",
      "Monica Fine! Judge all you want to but, (points to Ross) married a lesbian, (points to Rachel) left a man at the altar, (points to Phoebe) fell in love with a gay ice dancer, (points to Joey) threw a girl’s wooden leg in a fire, (points to Chandler) livin’ in a box!! (goes to her room)\n",
      "Rachel So now, what exactly is the point of the box?\n",
      "Joey Chandler?\n",
      "Chandler The meaning of the box is three fold. One (holds a finger up through the air hole), it gives me the time to think about what I did. Two (holds up another finger), it proves how much I care about my friendship with Joey. And three (holds up a third finger), it hurts!\n",
      "Ross (to Rachel) Oh hey! Hey uh, you remember the necklace I gave you last year? Can I see it?\n",
      "Rachel (worried) Why?\n",
      "Ross I just wanna check something.\n",
      "Rachel Okay. (She goes into her bedroom)\n",
      "Ross (He puts his hand over the hole on the box.) (to Chandler) Now, we’ll see.\n",
      "Chandler Air hole! Air hole!! (Ross retracts his hand quickly.)\n",
      "Rachel (coming out of her bedroom with a necklace) Here it is! I love it. I wear it all the time.\n",
      "Ross (grabbing the necklace) The necklace I got you was gold, this one is silver.\n",
      "Rachel Huh, well maybe it uh, it changed.\n",
      "Ross Oh my God! You actually exchanged it!\n",
      "Rachel Well isn’t it better that I exchanged it for something that I enjoy and that I can get a lot of use out of?\n",
      "Ross What did you get?\n",
      "Rachel Credit.\n",
      "Monica (running in from her bedroom) I’ll get it! I’ll get it! I’ll get it! I’ll get it! I’ll get it! I’ll get it! I’ll get it! I’ll get it! I’ll get it! I’ll get it! I’ll get it! I’ll get it! I’ll get it! I’ll get it! (opens the door) Hi, Tim.\n",
      "Tim Hi. (gives her a bottle of wine)\n",
      "Monica Thank you. Come meet my friends. This is uh, Phoebe.\n",
      "Tim Hi, nice to meet you.\n",
      "Monica And Joey.\n",
      "Joey Hey!\n",
      "Tim Hi, Joey.\n",
      "Monica My brother, Ross.\n",
      "Ross Hey.\n",
      "Monica And Rachel. (Chandler clears his voice loudly) And that’s Chandler.\n",
      "Chandler How do ya do.\n",
      "Tim What’s…\n",
      "Monica Umm, well, he’s…\n",
      "Joey He’s doin’ some thinkin’!\n",
      "Chandler What happened? What happened?!\n",
      "Joey You kissed my girlfriend!\n",
      "Rachel Ooh, I like those sunglasses.\n",
      "Ross Like ‘em, like ‘em? Or, I’d like to get store credit for that amount like ‘em?\n",
      "Rachel (Swears in Italian, it’s the same term used by Joey earlier and Joey nods his approval.)\n",
      "Monica All right everybody, this turkey is ready!\n",
      "Tim Where can I wash up?\n",
      "Monica Here, let me show you. Okay, the towels are hanging next to the sink, and umm, you can use the fancy soap.\n",
      "Tim Thank you.\n",
      "Rachel Fancy soap? I thought we were savin’ that for the Pope!\n",
      "Monica See he’s nice. Right?\n",
      "Phoebe Yeah, but Monica, do you actually want to be in a relationship where you can actually use the phrase, \"That’s not how your dad used to do it.\"\n",
      "Tim Wow! Everything looks great! Where should I sit?\n",
      "Monica I saved you a seat. (Motions to the one next to her.)\n",
      "Rachel (pouring the wine) Sick-sick-sick-sick.\n",
      "Phoebe Oh, I’ll get it. (goes over to the door.)\n",
      "Chandler Gotcha! (laughs)\n",
      "Joey That doesn’t sound like thinking to me!\n",
      "Chandler Sorry!\n",
      "Joey Y’know I don’t think you should be talking at all in there! I think you’ve got to much thinking to do to be talking and making jokes!\n",
      "Chandler Okay, okay, you got it!\n",
      "Rachel Ross, can you pass me the yams?\n",
      "Ross Sure! Oh, and Joey’s got the mashed potatoes if you want to exchange them.\n",
      "Rachel Would you stop?! What is the matter with you?!\n",
      "Monica Oh-ho-ho, we’ve got company.\n",
      "Ross There’s nothing the matter with me. See, I’m not completely devoid of sentiment, see I have feelings.\n",
      "Rachel Okay, fine. (She gets up and walks into her bedroom)\n",
      "Chandler You can’t tell, but I’m trying to break the tension by mooning you guys!\n",
      "Joey All right, look! If this is just a big joke to you, then forget about it, all right?! This means something to me! And if it doesn’t mean anything to you, then you should get out of there, otherwise you’re just an idiot in a box!\n",
      "Chandler You’re right, and I’m sorry! This means a lot to me! I want you to be my friend again! I swear, I won’t say another word tonight.\n",
      "Joey So are you gonna start taking this thing seriously?\n",
      "Chandler Absolutely!\n",
      "Joey That sounds like another word to me! Are you gonna take this seriously? (There’s no response from Chandler.) Okay.\n",
      "Rachel Don’t say that I have no sentiment! (Starts to show Ross what’s in the box.) This is a movie stub from our first date! This is an eggshell from the first time you made me breakfast in bed! (Holds up a bone) This is from the museum from the first time we… were together. Okay, maybe I exchange gifts sometimes, but I keep the things that matter!\n",
      "Ross I don’t know what to say, I’m sorry. Though, you’re not supposed to take these. (Points to the bone) It’s like a million years old, we, we actually, we had people looking for that.\n",
      "Monica (putting off her coat) Ooh, this always happens. (Her coat gets stuck.)\n",
      "Tim Here, let me help. (Does so.)\n",
      "Monica Thank you.\n",
      "Tim You-you have a very beautiful… eye.\n",
      "Monica Y’know all my friends think this is weird.\n",
      "Tim Y’know I-I thought it was gonna be weird, I mean I almost called and canceled, but it really isn’t.\n",
      "Monica I know! I mean it’s like me and your dad, that’s a totally separate thing.\n",
      "Tim Oh, I totally agree.\n",
      "Monica We’re just two people who find each other very attractive. Right?\n",
      "Tim What?\n",
      "Monica Nothing. Nothing.\n",
      "Tim No-no really, was-was that not okay?\n",
      "Monica No-no-no that was good, it was, that was uh, that was a goood kiss…\n",
      "Tim Oh my God! It didn’t remind you of…\n",
      "Monica (interrupting) Don’t say it!\n",
      "Tim No, but it did! Didn’t it?!\n",
      "Monica Yeah!\n",
      "Tim Oh man!!\n",
      "Monica I know!\n",
      "Joey I’ll get it. (It’s Kathy.)\n",
      "Kathy (sees it’s Joey) Oh.\n",
      "Joey Hey.\n",
      "Kathy Hey. Listen, I want you to know how sorry I am…\n",
      "Joey That’s okay. Chandler’s the one I’m mad at.\n",
      "Kathy Well, I’m still sorry. Is he here?\n",
      "Joey In the box.\n",
      "Kathy (going over to the box) Chandler?\n",
      "Phoebe Oh, he-he can’t talk right now.\n",
      "Kathy Why not? What’s going on?\n",
      "Phoebe He’s just trying to show Joey how much he means to him.\n",
      "Kathy By being in a box?\n",
      "Rachel Joey, had reasons.\n",
      "Phoebe They were threefold.\n",
      "Kathy Oh. Well uh, (to Chandler) you not being able to talk may make this easier. Listen umm… (She looks at the gang who are watching, they take the hint and leave them alone.) Listen I don’t wanna be someone who comes between two best friends. I just, I can’t stand seeing what this is doing to you guys, and I don’t wanna be the cause of that. So, I don’t think we can see each other anymore. I’m gonna go to my mom’s in Chicago, I’m gonna stay there for awhile. I think this could’ve be something really amazing, but y’know this is probably for the best. Y’know? I’m gonna miss you. Good-bye, Chandler.\n",
      "Joey (starting to cry) Open the box!! (Runs over to do so.)\n",
      "Rachel What?!\n",
      "Joey He can still catch her! Come on, get out of there! (He opens the box) Get out of there!\n",
      "Chandler So?\n",
      "Joey Yeah, we’re gonna be fine! Get out!\n",
      "Chandler Yeah?\n",
      "Joey Yeah, you did some real good thinkin’ in there.\n",
      "Chandler Man, this is…\n",
      "Joey Now go! ‘Cause you can still catch her! And Merry Christmas from you’re secret Santa! (Chandler runs out and closes the door.)\n",
      "Joey All right, who got Chandler? ‘Cause I uh, need to trade.\n",
      "Rachel Oh, he sees her!\n",
      "Monica Oh, he’s catching up to her!\n",
      "Phoebe Oh, she sees him! Oh, they’re hugging!\n",
      "Ross He’s taking her purse!\n",
      "Joey Uhh, that’s not them. I’m gonna go call the police.\n",
      "Phoebe Oh, there they are!\n",
      "Phoebe All right, get a room.\n",

      "Alice (laughs) No. No. No. (Sits down.) Okay, now, see, I wanna name the girl baby Leslie, and Frank wants to name one of the boy babies Frank JR. JR.\n",
      "Chandler Wouldn’t that be Frank the III?\n",
      "Alice Don’t get me started. (To Phoebe) Anyway, umm, since there are three babies and umm, we both got to put our names in, we would be truly honoured if you named the other boy baby.\n",
      "Phoebe Wow! That’s so great! Oh! Oh! Cougar.\n",
      "Alice You think about it. (Leaves)\n",
      "Emily I left a bra drying on the shower rod, you don’t think your son will think it’s yours and be horribly traumatised?\n",

      "Chandler Well, it certainly worked for that Valdez kid.\n",
      "Joey Ooh-ooh, Pheebs, you want a strong name? How about, The Hulk?\n",
      "Phoebe No, I’m-I’m not sure about Hulk, but I like the idea of a name starting with \"The.\"\n",
      "Joey Oh, want a good name, go with Joey. Joey’s your pal. Joey’s your buddy. \"Where is everybody?\" \"Well, they’re hanging out with Joey.\"\n",
      "Chandler Hey, y’know what, if you’re gonna do that, if you’re gonna name him Joey, you should name him Chandler. (Phoebe doesn’t think so.) Oh, come on! Chandler’s funny, sophisticated, and he’s very loveable, once you get to know him.\n",

      "Chandler Well, Chandler will be there for you too. I mean, well, he might be a little late, but-but, he’ll be there. And he’ll bring you some cold soda, if want you need him for is that you’re really hot.\n",
      "Joey What do ya say? What do ya say?\n",
      "Phoebe Well, I, I like the idea of naming him after someone I love, and Joey and Chandler are great names. (They both stare at her.) But, all right, I don’t—maybe I’ll just name him The Hulk.\n",
      "Joey I knew I shouldn’t have mentioned it! That’s what I wanted to name my kid!\n",
      "Rachel Hey, Mon, if you were hoping to sleep with Joshua the first time tonight, which one of these would you want to be wearing. (She’s holding two frilly, lace nighties.)\n",
      "Monica Y’know what? It really creeps me out choosing other people’s sex clothes.\n",
      "Rachel Sorry. I’m so exited! I’ve been waiting for this for months! I got my hair coloured! I got new sheets! I’m making him a very fancy meal.\n",
      "Monica Um-hmm.\n",
      "Rachel What am I making him by the way?\n",
      "Monica Well, you’re making him a frieze salad with goat cheese and pine nuts, wild nuts, wild rice, roast asparagus, and salmon au croup.\n",
      "Rachel I thought I was making him filet mignon?\n",
      "Monica Yeah, you were, but you decided to make salmon because you had some left over at the restaurant. And then you realised if you (Points at Rachel) bitched about it, then you (Points to herself) would stop cooking, and you (Points at Rachel) would have to make your famous baked potato and Diet Coke.\n",
      "Rachel Wow, I really get crabby when I cook.\n",
      "Ross Hey!\n",
      "Joey Hey!\n",

      "Ross Turns out them Emily is just crazy about Susan. Yeah, they’re going to the theatre together! They’re going to dinner! They’re going horseback riding!\n",
      "Phoebe God, Susan is so fun!\n",
      "Ross Look, this is just a little too familiar, okay? For like, for like six months before Carol and I spilt up, all I heard was: \"My friend Susan is so smart. My friend Susan is so funny. My friend Susan is so great.\"\n",
      "Chandler You actually think that something can happen between Emily and Susan?\n",
      "Ross Hey, they’re going to the gym together! Two women! Stretching! Y’know they-they take a steam together! Things get a little playful—didn’t you see Personal Best?\n",
      "Joey No, but I’m gonna!\n",
      "Chandler Hi! Hi! You’re crazy! Okay? This is Emily. Emily is straight.\n",
      "Ross How do you know? I mean we thought Carol was straight before I married her!\n",
      "Phoebe Yeah, I definitely. I don’t like the name Ross.\n",
      "Ross What a weird way to kick me when I’m down.\n",
      "Phoebe No! No! I-I meant for the baby!\n",
      "Ross Oh. What’s wrong with Ross?\n",
      "Phoebe Well, it’s just y’know that something like this would never to like The Hulk, y’know…\n",
      "Ross Actually that-that’s not true, in The Incredible Hulk uh, No. 72, Dr. Bruce Banner found… (Sees everyone staring at him and stops.) Y’know, ugh, nevermind, my girlfriend’s a lesbian. (Leaves.)\n",
      "Phoebe So, I decided I’m definitely going to go with either Joey or Chandler.\n",
      "Joey Oh! Oh-oh, you gotta pick Joey! I mean, name one famous person named Chandler.\n",
      "Chandler Raymond Chandler.\n",
      "Joey Someone you didn’t make up!\n",
      "Chandler Okay, there are no famous Joey’s. Except for, huh, Joey Buttafucco.\n",
      "Joey Yeah, that guy really hurt us.\n",
      "Phoebe Well, how about a compromise then, okay? What if it’s like y’know, Chanoey?\n",
      "Chandler Okay, look, Joey! Come on, think about it, first of all, he’ll never be President. There’s never gonna be a President Joey.\n",
      "Joey All right look man, I didn’t want to bring this up, but Chandler, is the stupidest name I ever heard in my life! It’s not even a name; it’s barely even a word. Okay? It’s kinda like chandelier, but it’s not! All right? It’s a stupid, stupid non-name!\n",
      "Chandler Wow, you’re, you’re right. I have a horrible, horrible name.\n",
      "Joey I’m sorry man, I didn’t—I’m-I’m sorry. I’m sorry. (Goes over and comforts him.)\n",
      "Chandler Okay.\n",
      "Joey So I guess it’s Joey then!\n",
      "Joshua This is so nice. Thank you for doing this.\n",
      "Rachel Ohh, please! Cooking soothes me. (They kiss.) Ahh. So, dig in!\n",
      "Joshua Great! Oh, it all looks sooo good!\n",
      "Rachel (taking a bite) Hmmm!\n",
      "Joshua Oh my God!\n",
      "Rachel Oh I know, my God, this is so—this rice is so—I am so good.\n",
      "Joshua Behind you?\n",
      "Rachel (sees the chick and the duck) Oh, yeah, I’m sorry. They used to live here; sometimes they migrate back over.\n",
      "Joshua (getting up and backing away from they.) Is there ah, is there some way they can not be here. It’s just ah, farm birds really kinda freak me out!\n",
      "Rachel Yeah, sure, okay. Okay.\n",
      "Joey (answering the door.) Hey, how did you do that?! Come on in. (He brings them inside.)\n",
      "Rachel All gone! So, farm birds, huh?\n",
      "Joshua Yeah, it’s-it’s my only weird thing, I swear. And I-I-I would’ve told you about it, but I didn’t know they would be here.\n",
      "Rachel Oh.\n",
      "Joshua So, all right.\n",
      "Rachel Okay. So, can I serve you a little of—What? What? What? (She sees that Joshua isn’t relaxed.)\n",
      "Joshua Nothing I uh, it’s just that I know that they’re still out there.\n",
      "Rachel But, they’re across the hall! I mean that’s two doors away, it would take them a long time to peck their way back over here.\n",
      "Joshua Okay, that’s-that’s not funny. Uhh.\n",
      "Rachel Okay, y’know, would you feel better if we went someplace else? I mean we could pack all this stuff up and y’know go to your apartment.\n",
      "Joshua Oh, they’re working on this week, it’s a total mess. But uh, I’m staying at my parents’ house, we could go there.\n",
      "Rachel Your parents’?\n",
      "Joshua Yeah, they’re out of town.\n",
      "Rachel Ohh.\n",
      "Joshua Yeah-yeah, it’s this huge place, and-and it’s got this gorgeous view of the park, and very, very romantic. What do you say?\n",
      "Rachel Yeah that works.\n",
      "Joshua They-they-they can smell fear.\n",
      "Ross (opening the door.) Hey!\n",
      "Carol Hey! How’s Ben?\n",
      "Ross Well, I asked him if he wanted to eat, he said, \"No.\" I asked him if he wanted to sleep, he said, \"No.\" I asked him what he wanted to do, he said, \"No.\" So, he’s sweeping. (We see Ben playing with a broom and a dustpan.)\n",
      "Carol Hey, Ben! Hey!\n",
      "Ross So umm, any word from Susan?\n",
      "Carol Ooh, yeah! She said she’s having sooo much fun with Emily.\n",
      "Ross Uh-huh. Uh-huh. Uh, by the by, did it uh, did it ever occur to you that, I don’t know, maybe they might be having a little too much fun?\n",
      "Carol What’s too much fun?\n",
      "Ross Y’know, the kind of fun, you and Susan had when we were married.\n",
      "Carol Oh my God, you are so paranoid!\n",
      "Ross Am I?!\n",
      "Carol Yes!\n",
      "Ross Am I?!\n",
      "Carol I can’t speak for Emily, but Susan is in a loving, committed relationship.\n",
      "Ross Uh-huh, Carol, so were we. All right, just-just imagine for a moment, Susan meets someone and-and they really hit it off. Y’know? Say-say they’re coming back from the theatre, and they-they stop at a pub for a couple of drinks, they’re laughing, y’know, someone innocently touches someone else… There’s electricity, it’s new. It’s exciting. Are you telling me there isn’t even the slightest possibility of something happening?\n",
      "Carol Maybe.\n",
      "Ross OH MY GOD!! I didn’t really believe it until you just said it!!\n",
      "Joshua …and even though none of the other kids believed me, I swear to God, that duck pushed me!\n",
      "Rachel Wow! This place is fabulous!\n",
      "Joshua Yeah, yeah, let me show you around. This is the uh, downstairs living room.\n",
      "Rachel Whoa-whoa, there’s two living rooms? God, growing up here, this place must’ve been a real babe magnet.\n",
      "Joshua Yeah, well, it would’ve been, but uh, my parents just moved here.\n",
      "Rachel Ohh, you should know, this place is a real babe magnet. Wanna make out?\n",
      "Joshua Hey, here’s an idea. Why don’t uh, I put the food in the fridge and we can eat it later?\n",
      "Rachel That sounds like a plan. Umm, is there a place I can go freshen up?\n",
      "Joshua Oh yeah, yeah uh, it’s down the hall and uh, second door to your left.\n",
      "Rachel Ah.\n",
      "Mrs. Burgin Oh, hi, darling!\n",
      "Joshua Mom, Dad, what are you guys doing here?\n",
      "Mrs. Burgin Oh, well we cut the trip short.\n",
      "Mr. Burgin France sucks!\n",
      "Joshua Umm, this may be a little weird, but I-I-I got a date here.\n",
      "Mrs. Burgin Oh, say no more!\n",
      "Mr. Burgin We’ll just grab some food and take it with us right upstairs, and we’ll be right out of you hair.\n",
      "Joshua Oh, that-that would be great. So you didn’t even get to Italy?\n",
      "Mr. Burgin Yep, sucks!\n",
      "Rachel Hi you!\n",
      "Joshua Oh my God!\n",

      "Chandler No I’m serious, we should tell each other everything. I do not have any secrets from you.\n",
      "Monica Really? Okay, so why don’t you tell me what happened to Ross Junior year at Disneyland?\n",
      "Chandler Oh no-no, I can’t do that.\n",
      "Monica If you tell me, I’ll tell you what Phoebe said.\n",
      "Chandler Okay.\n",
      "Monica Okay.\n",
      "Chandler So, Ross and I are going to Disneyland and we stop at this restaurant for tacos. And when I say restaurant, I mean a guy, a hibachi, and the trunk of his car. So Ross has about 10 tacos. And anyway, we’re on Space Mountain and Ross starts to feel a little iffy.\n",
      "Monica Oh my God. He threw up?\n",
      "Chandler No, he visited a little town south of throw up. (Monica laughs hysterically.) So what was Phoebe’s secret?\n",
      "Monica Oh, Nancy Thompson from Phoebe’s old massage place is getting fired.\n",
      "Chandler That’s it?! I gave up my Disneyland story for that?\n",
      "Monica That’s right! You lose sucker!! (Pause) Please still marry me.\n",
      "Rachel Chandler, you have an assistant right?\n",
      "Chandler (angrily) Did she call? You-you told her I was sick right? Always tell her I am sick!\n",
      "Rachel No, I-I just don’t know how you decide who to hire. I mean I’ve got it narrowed down to two people. One of them has great references and a lot of experience and then there’s this guy…\n",
      "Chandler What about him?\n",
      "Rachel I love him. He’s so pretty I wanna cry! I don’t know what to do. Tell me what to do.\n",
      "Phoebe Come on you know what to do! You hire the first one! You don’t hire an assistant because they’re cute, you hire them because they’re qualified.\n",
      "Rachel Uh-huh. No, I hear what you’re saying and-and-and that makes a lot of sense but can I just say one more thing? (Takes out his picture.) Look how pretty!\n",
      "Phoebe Let’s see. (Looking at the picture) Oh my God! Oh… But no! No! You can’t-you can’t hire him, because that—it’s not professional. Umm, this is for me (The picture) yes? Thanks. (Puts it in her pocket.)\n",
      "Rachel Okay you’re right. I’ll hire Hilda tomorrow. Dumb old perfect for the job Hilda!\n",
      "Chandler Let me see this guy. (Phoebe hands him the picture.) W-H-Wow! Don’t show this to Monica! And don’t tell her about the W-H-Wow!\n",
      "Terry Hey-hey-hey Joey!\n",

      "Terry Why don’t we start right now!\n",
      "Joey Okay.\n",
      "Terry Here are the audition scenes. (Holds out the script.)\n",
      "Joey (looking between the pages and him) Audition? I thought you were gonna offer me the part.\n",
      "Terry Why would you think that?\n",
      "Joey Well, I was Dr. Drake Remoray, Stryker’s twin brother. I mean, who looks more me than me right?\n",
      "Terry Everybody has to audition.\n",
      "Joey Y’know Terry, I-I don’t really need to do this. I got my own cable TV series, (Pause) with a robot.\n",
      "Terry I’m sorry Joey that’s…that’s the way it is.\n",
      "Joey Well. I guess you think you’re pretty special huh? Sittin’ up here in your fancy small hall building. Makin’ stars jump through hoops for ya, huh? Well y’know what? (Throws the script away) This is one star who’s hoop… This is a star that the hoop—this hoop—I was Dr. Drake Remoray!\n",
      "Rachel Hi! Tag. What are you doing here?\n",
      "Tag I just wanted to come by and thank you for not laughing in my face yesterday. And I noticed there aren’t any plants in your office so I wanted to bring you your first… (Notices her plant) There is a plant in your office.\n",
      "Rachel Kinda.\n",
      "Tag Right. So I guess I shouldn’t put good at noticing stuff on my resume. (Sets the plant down on her desk.)\n",
      "Rachel Oh-ohh, thank you.\n",
      "Tag Anyway, I’m guessing you hired somebody.\n",
      "Rachel Well…\n",
      "Tag Gotcha. Thanks again for meeting with me. (Starts to leave.)\n",
      "Rachel But I hired you!\n",
      "Tag What?\n",
      "Rachel Yeah! You-you got the job! You’re my new assistant!\n",
      "Tag I am?!\n",
      "Rachel Yeah!\n",
      "Tag I can’t believe it!\n",
      "Rachel Me either. Umm, all right, first thing I need you to do is go downstairs and find a women named Hilda and tell her to go home.\n",
      "Chandler Hey.\n",
      "Monica Hey! Good, you’re home!\n",
      "Chandler Oh it’s always nicer to here than, \"Aw crap! You again!\"\n",

      "Chandler Hey! What’s up?\n",
      "Monica Ross!\n",
      "Ross Oh, nothin’ much. Just trying to figure out what I’m gonna do for dinner.\n",
      "Chandler Huh.\n",
      "Ross (notices the table) Hey—Ooh! What’s-what’s that, dinner stuff? You making dinner?\n",
      "Chandler No! (The oven dings.) Shhh!\n",
      "Ross What you got over there? Tacos?\n",
      "Monica No! No. They’re umm… They’re just uh…ground beef smileys. (Holding up one of the shells.)\n",
      "Ross Uhh, those are tacos.\n",
      "Monica Excuse me Mr. Mexico.\n",
      "Ross Eh, either way I’ll pass. (Quietly to Chandler) I still can’t eat those. (Monica is getting something out of the fridge and starts laughing.) What’s so funny?!\n",
      "Monica (trying not to laugh) I’m not laughing.\n",
      "Ross (To Chandler) You told her!\n",
      "Chandler Nancy Thompson’s getting fired! (Monica slaps him on the shoulder.)\n",
      "Ross (To Monica) Look, okay-okay I had food poisoning! It’s not like I choose to do it! It’s not like—It’s not like I said, \"Umm, what would make this ride more fun?!\"\n",
      "Monica You’re right. I mean I’m sorry. Yeah, I shouldn’t be laughing. I should be laying down papers for you! (Runs off laughing which gets Chandler laughing.)\n",
      "Ross (To Chandler) How could you tell her?!\n",
      "Chandler I had too okay?! We’re getting married! Married couples can’t keep secrets from one another!\n",
      "Ross Oh really? Well I-I guess Monica should know about Atlantic City.\n",
      "Chandler Du-ude!\n",
      "Monica (running up to Ross) What happened in Atlantic City?!\n",
      "Ross Well, Chandler and I are in a bar…\n",
      "Chandler Did you not hear me say, \"Du-ude?!\"\n",
      "Ross And this girl is making eyes at Chandler, okay? So after awhile he-he goes over to her and uh, after a minute or two, I see them kissing. Now, I know what you’re thinking, Chandler’s not the type of guy who just goes to bars and makes out with girls, and you’re right, Chandler’s not the type of guy who just goes to bars and makes out with…girls.\n",
      "Monica (To Chandler) You kissed a guy?!! Oh my God.\n",
      "Chandler In my defense, it was dark and he was a very pretty guy.\n",
      "Ross Oh Mon, I laughed so hard…\n",
      "Chandler Ho-ho, so hard we had to throw out your underwear again?\n",
      "Ross Whatever dude, you kissed a guy.\n",

      "Chandler Ross came in forth and cried!\n",
      "Monica Oh my God! (Laughing)\n",
      "Ross Oh, is that funny?! Oh, you-you find that funny?! Well maybe Chandler should know some of your secrets too!\n",
      "Monica I-I already told him everything! (Threateningly) You shush!!\n",
      "Ross Once Monica was sent to her room without dinner, so she ate the macaroni off a jewelry box she’d made.\n",
      "Monica Ross used to stay up every Saturday night to watch Golden Girls!\n",
      "Ross Monica couldn’t tell time ‘til she was 13!\n",
      "Monica It’s hard for some people!\n",

      "Ross Ohh! Ohh! In college, Chandler got drunk and slept with the lady who cleaned our dorm!\n",
      "Chandler That was you!\n",
      "Ross Whatever dude, you kissed a guy.\n",
      "Joey How could this happen to me?! Yesterday I had two TV shows! Today, I got nothin’!\n",
      "Rachel Well wait a minute, what happened to Days of Our Lives?\n",
      "Joey Uh, well they might be a little mad at me over there.\n",
      "Phoebe What happened?\n",
      "Joey Well maybe I got a little upset and maybe I told them where they could go.\n",
      "Rachel Joey, why would you do that?\n",
      "Joey Because they wanted me to audition!\n",
      "Phoebe You! An actor?! That’s madness!\n",

      "Phoebe So you hired yourself a little treat did ya?\n",
      "Rachel All right I know, I know how it looks Pheebs, but I’m telling you…\n",
      "Phoebe But-but you know you cannot get involved with your assistant.\n",
      "Rachel Yes, I know that. I know that. And I know that hiring him was probably not the smartest thing that I’ve ever done. But I’m telling you, from this moment on I swear this is strictly professional. (There’s a knock on the door.) Yes?\n",

(he turns, but then he turns again and is sprayed in the front again) Ah! (he spits and angrily goes out of the spray-on tan booth and the assistant enters the room) The same thing happened again!\n",
      "Assistant You got two more twos?\n",
      "Ross (hysterically) I'm an eight!\n",

      "Monica Hi Amanda! Actually now... it’s... is not a good time. Dinner tomorrow night? (Phoebe mouths 'no') Ok, Phoebe and I will see you then!\n",
      "Phoebe Why, why, why didn’t you just say no!\n",
      "Monica Well, I said 'no' to her coming over now! I couldn’t say 'no' twice! I get this uncontrollable need to please people!\n",
      "Phoebe (leaving) Fine, fine! You would not hold up well under torture!\n",
      "Monica And you would?\n",
      "Phoebe I did!\n",
      "Joey Rach, you sure you wanna do this?\n",
      "Rachel Absolutely! Absolutely. I d... it’s just a little weird, it’s you, and it’s me, it's just gonna take some getting used to.\n",
      "Joey Ok. Well, how, how can we make it easier?\n",
      "Rachel Ok, let’s work from the top down! (Joey nods, but then puzzled because he does not get it) Just work the bra, Joe!\n",
      "Joey Ok, yeah, got it.\n",
      "Rachel and Joey Okay.\n",
      "Joey This thing welded shut?!\n",

      "Rachel Oh!\n",
      "Rachel Ow!\n",
      "Joey Sorry!\n",
      "Rachel Well this is romantic!\n",
      "Joey I'm sorry! (He stands up) This never happened to me before! I'm an expert at taking off bras! I can do it with one hand! I can do it with my eyes closed! One time I just looked at one, and it popped open! I blame your bra!\n",
      "Rachel It’s a standard issue bra clasp!\n",
      "Joey Then I blame you! Yeah! That's right! You threw me off with all your slapping!\n",
      "Rachel Ok well, well I'm really, I'm sorry about that Joey, but do you think that maybe on some level, you don't want to take off my bra?\n",
      "Joey (contemplates for a few moments what Rachel just said) NAH! I don't have another level!!\n",
      "Chandler Hold on! There is something different.\n",
      "Ross I went to that tanning place your wife suggested.\n",
      "Chandler Was that place... The Sun?\n",
      "Ross Oh! And it gets worse! (Turns his side to Chandler and Monica and pulls up his shirt. There's a distinct line across his body, where his belly is very tanned and his back is very pale.)\n",
      "Chandler Oh My God! You can do a duet of Ebony and Ivory all by yourself!\n",
      "Monica How could you mess this up? It's so easy? You go into the booth, you count to five and you turn around!!\n",
      "Ross (looks at her suspiciously) How do you count to five?\n",
      "Monica One Two Three...\n",
      "Ross (Yells) Damnit! (Goes to the door to leave. Rachel just enters, sees him and starts laughing)\n",
      "Rachel (laughing) oooh! Oh oh!\n",
      "Ross (Still yelling) I Know!\n",
      "Rachel oh oh! What is up with Miss Hawaiian Tropic?\n",
      "Chandler How was your date with Joey?\n",
      "Rachel Well, it was good.. until we got back to our apartment, and then we were fooling around and he started to put his hand up my leg and I kept slapping it away!\n",
      "Chandler You didn't like that?\n",
      "Rachel Well, it wasn't just me, alright? He freaked out too! He couldn't even undo my bra!\n",
      "Monica Wow, really? One time he just looked at my bra and it popped open.\n",
      "Rachel I do not know what's wrong with us, I mean, we have kissed before and that's been great! But this time it was leading somewhere and I was very aware of the fact that it was Joey touching me.\n",
      "Monica Well, you guys have been friends forever. Remember the first time that you kissed Ross? How weird that was? You couldn't stop laughing? You got through that.\n",
      "Rachel (looking thoughtful) Ok, that's true. That's true, we can do this. You're right, you're right, we can do this. We're just gonna power through!\n",
      "Joey Hey Chandler can I talk to you for a second (points to the hall).\n",
      "Rachel (To Joey) No need!! Problem solved, we are powering through (At which point she grabs his hand and pulls him back to their apartment).\n",
      "Monica (sees what he is doing) Chandler, stop! It is not going to pop open!\n",
      "Chandler (without taking his eyes off the bra) You don't know! (Monica just smiles)\n",
      "Monica Hey Phoebe!\n",
      "Phoebe Hey!\n",
      "Monica Is Amanda here yet?\n",
      "Phoebe No.\n",
      "Monica (sits down) Oh good. Good, look I'm so sorry, for screwing up that cutting-her-out plan. But I have a new plan. Chandler agreed to call here in a few minutes with an emergency.\n",
      "Phoebe Oh! Well, what kind of emergency that gets us both out of here?\n",
      "Monica Well, what do you think of Mike and Chandler being in a car accident?\n",
      "Phoebe (makes a face) Are you kidding, I love it!\n",
      "Phoebe Hi!\n",
      "Monica Hi!\n",
      "Amanda Hi! (Phoebe and Amanda hug)\n",
      "Amanda (To Monica) Hello!\n",
      "Amanda (In a fake British accent) It's so nice to see you! Both of you! Look at me. Look how young I look! (gives her coat to Monica as well) Oh gosh! We have so much to catch up on! But first things first: touch my abs (at which point she grabs both Phoebe and Monica's hands and places them both on her stomach) I don't exercise at all! (she pulls them down to sit.) Oh gosh, so Monica, you're married!\n",
      "Monica (beaming) Yeah! Yeah! His name is Chandler and...\n",
      "Amanda (To Phoebe) Smell my neck! (Phoebe does so) It's not perfume! It's me! It's my natural scent!\n",
      "Phoebe Musty!\n",
      "Amanda Oh! Gosh! This is brilliant. Gosh, it's just like old times. I'm so happy you two are friends again!\n",
      "Monica When were we not friends?\n",
      "Amanda Well, it was 1992, and I remember because that was the year I had sex with Evil Knievel (She starts laughing very proudly).\n",
      "Monica Ehm, we were friends in 1992.\n",
      "Amanda (to Phoebe) No I distinctly remember you were dodging her (points at Monica) calls and trying to avoid seeing her.\n",
      "Monica (To Phoebe) You were going to cut me out?\n",
      "Phoebe Well...kinda.\n",
      "Monica Oh My God!\n",
      "Amanda Oh! Bugger. Should I not have said that? I feel like a perfect arse!\n",
      "Phoebe Yeah well, in America you're just an \"ass\".\n",
      "Monica (Into the phone) Hello? Chandler, what's wrong? (She listens) Oh my God, are you alright? (listens some more) Yeah, I'll be right there. (She hangs up and speaks to Amanda) I'm so sorry, but Chandler was in a car accident. (She gets up)\n",
      "Phoebe (Also gets up and starts taking her purse) Oh my God. Was Mike with him?\n",
      "Monica Nope! (She turns and leaves)\n",
      "Joey (To Rachel) Hey!\n",
      "Rachel Hey! Got champagne?\n",
      "Joey Yes ma'am, ready to Power through!\n",
      "Rachel Excellent! Stick it in the ice bucket, the phone is off the hook, and in the interest of powering through (Starts to remove her bra from under her clothes)...\n",
      "Joey Uh! (When she's done she throws her bra at him)\n",
      "Rachel Ok (starts to light some candles) Sexy, sexy, very sexy, sexy. (Claps her hands and jumps at Joey, clearly very excited) Alright! Lets do it!\n",
      "Joey Ok, you're scaring me a little bit.\n",
      "Rachel Oh! Get over it soldier, we've gotta do this! (She pulls him towards her and throws him onto the barcalounger) Ok. Aha! You like that huh?\n",
      "Joey Oh! yeah!\n",
      "Rachel You like that? (She climbs on the barcalounger seductively, putting her knees next to Joey's hips.) Let's take this into high gear (She pulls the barcalounger lever and seat reclines. She puts one of her knees between his legs and begins to kiss his neck.)\n",
      "Joey uh uh!\n",
      "Rachel Yeah baby, I'll show you how we do it!\n",
      "Joey No, no, no! You kneed me in my misters!\n",
      "Rachel What? Oh my God! I'm so sorry. Joey? Are you ok?\n",
      "Joey (He just sits there, legs very close together with a painful look on his face) Soldier down!\n",
      "Monica We are not friends with Phoebe anymore.\n",
      "Chandler If she asks, I protested a little, but ok!\n",
      "Phoebe Oh Chandler! Thank God you're alive. Monica, can I talk to you outside for a minute?\n",
      "Monica I have nothing to say to you.\n",
      "Amanda (announces more to herself than anyone else) Wow, my flat is twice this size!\n",
      "Phoebe Please, Monica? In the hall?\n",
      "Amanda Ooh, that accident must have been terrible. You look positively ghastly.\n",
      "Chandler Well, aren't you a treat.\n",
      "Monica I can't believe you tried to cut me out. Why Phoebe, why?\n",
      "Phoebe It was right after we were living together and you were driving me crazy, okay? You were really controlling and compulsive and shrill.\n",

      "Ross No, God! Hey, Rach, you've been an amazing daughter, ok? Right now you just need to get some rest.\n",
      "Rachel Ok, maybe you're right.\n",
      "Ross (he kisses her on her forehead) Good night.\n",
      "Rachel Wait, wait, wait, wait. Would you stay here with me for a little while?\n",
      "Ross Sure!\n",
      "Rachel Ok. (She sits on the bed and Ross sits near her) Thank you for coming with me today.\n",
      "Ross Oh, of course...\n",
      "Rachel Rachel Green is very happy you're in her room!\n",
      "Ross Me too. Come here. (They hug)\n",
      "Rachel I just don't want to be alone tonight.\n",
      "Ross Ok, well, uh, I can maybe grab a sleeping bag, or...(There's one of those moments. They're staring at each other, no word uttered, and then she leans toward him in order to kiss him, but he ducks and avoids her more than once.) Oh, oh. (he then hugs her and when she tries to kiss him again, he stands up and she falls down on the bed). No, Rach! I'm sorry, I just don't think this, this, this is a good idea.\n",
      "Rachel Wait, we won't know that until we do it, will we?\n",
      "Ross No, look, uh. You are upset about your father and you're feeling vulnerable and I just don't feel it would be right, I'd feel like I'd be, you know, taking advantage of you.\n",
      "Rachel Taking advantage? I'm giving you the advantage, enjoy!\n",
      "Ross Look, I'm sure it would be great, but I-I think one of us has to be thinking clearly, so, I'm gonna go!\n",
      "Rachel Wow. Ok.\n",
      "Ross I'll see you in the morning (he leaves).\n",
      "Rachel Mhm-mh!\n",
      "Ross (outside her room, talking by himself) Haven't had sex in four months, I should get a medal for that!\n",
      "Erica Thanks so much for taking me to all those places. I had a great time.\n",
      "Monica Oh, I'm glad. Listen, I want to apologize about Chandler, though. I just did not see this coming.\n",
      "Chandler (enters the room wearing an \"I love New York\" t-shirt, a \"Statue of Liberty\" hat and carrying bags) New York is awesome!\n",
      "Monica What is with you?\n",
      "Chandler Yeah, I've been to these places before, but I've never really seen them, you know.\n",
      "Monica Yeah, you miss alot, when you're moo-ing.\n",
      "Erica Thanks so much for showing me around.\n",
      "Monica Oh! It was our pleasure. We are so much enjoying getting to know you.\n",
      "Erica Well, if there is anything else you wanna know... (Monica and Chandler look at each other)\n",
      "Chandler Oh, uhm, okay, uhm, do you mind if we ask you some questions about the father?\n",
      "Erica Oh, sure. Yeah, well, he was my high school boyfriend. Captain of the football team, really cute and he got a scholarship and went off to college. (Monica and Chandler are smiling from ear to ear)\n",
      "Chandler That's great.\n",
      "Erica Yeah... it's almost definitely him. (Monica and Chandler look confused now)\n",
      "Monica How's that now?\n",
      "Erica Well, there is a chance it's another guy. I mean, I have only ever been with two guys, but they sorta overlapped.\n",
      "Chandler So, what does the other guy do? Does he go to college too?\n",
      "Erica No, he's in prison. (More shocked looks from Monica and Chandler)\n",
      "Monica Was he falsely accused of something? (They look hopeful)\n",
      "Erica No... he killed his father with a shovel. (Monica and Chandler's jaws drop) But other than that, he's a great guy.\n",
      "Chandler I'll bet his dad doesn't think so.\n",
      "Monica Are you awake?\n",
      "Chandler Of course I'm awake. Assume from now on that I'm always awake! (He turns the light on)\n",
      "Monica Alright, we don't know that it's him. I mean, it could be the football guy.\n",
      "Chandler Honey, it's us. Of course it's the shovel-killer.\n",
      "Monica Alright, lets say that it is him, would we not want the baby? No! Would we treat him any differently?\n",
      "Chandler I'd keep an eye on him! We have to find out which one the father is.\n",
      "Monica How?\n",
      "Chandler I dunno, aren't there tests for these things, right?\n",
      "Monica Yeah, but maybe we're just over-reacting.\n",
      "Chandler Pff, easy for you to say, he's a father killer. He probably loves him mommy. He's probably got a tattoo that says \"mom\" on his shovel-wielding arm!\n",
      "Tape We will now count from one to five. Un, deux, trois, quatre, cinq.\n",

      "Joey Thank you.\n",
      "Phoebe Hey Joey.\n",
      "Joey Hey!\n",
      "Phoebe Listen, I feel really badly about yesterday and I thought about it a lot and, and I know, I was too impatient. SO lets try it again.\n",
      "Joey Oh, no, that's okay, I don't need your help. I worked on it myself and I gotta say, I am pretty good!\n",
      "Phoebe Really, can I hear some of it.\n",
      "Joey Sure, sure. Ok, (clears his throat and starts to read from his script. He starts talking in a fake French accent, making gestures with his hands) \"Bleu de la bleu, de la blu bla bleu\" (Phoebe looks astonished, annoyed and disgusted, Joey seems very proud though) See?\n",
      "Phoebe Well, you're not, (she tries to smile and contain her anger, but loses it) You're not... you're not... again, you're not SPEAKING FRENCH!\n",
      "Joey (offended) Oh well I think I am, yeah and I think I'm definitely gonna get the part.\n",
      "Phoebe How could you possibly think that?\n",
      "Joey For one thing, the guy on the tape said I was doing a good job!\n",
      "Ross Hey Rach, can you grab me a cup of coffee?\n",
      "Rachel (She turns around very slowly, looks at him for a second and then turns back to her coffee) Sure. (She gives him the cup she was pouring for herself without looking at him)\n",
      "Ross You've been quiet all morning. Is everything okay?\n",
      "Rachel Hmm-hmm. (starts to pour herself a cup of coffee, never looking at Ross)\n",
      "Ross You sure you're alright?\n",
      "Rachel (coldly) Yep.\n",
      "Ross (knowing she's not alright) O-kay. Well, I'm gonna go grab us some breakfast. (He starts to leave)\n",
      "Rachel FYI..\n",
      "Ross (knew this was coming) There it is... (he comes back)\n",
      "Rachel In the future, when a girl asks for some ill-advised sympathy sex... just do it. (she smiles fakely at him)\n",
      "Ross (half amused) Wait, wait, (looks around a little) You're mad at me about last night? I was just trying to do the right thing.\n",
      "Rachel (sarcastically) Really? Well, it seems to me if you'd done the right thing, I would not have woken up today feeling stupid and embarrassed, I would have woken up feeling comforted and satisfied!\n",
      "Ross (acknowledging the last part of her sentence) Well...\n",
      "Rachel Oh stop that!\n",
      "Ross I can't believe this. I was just being a good guy. I treated you with respect and understanding.\n",
      "Rachel (sarcastic) Oh, that is so hot. She walks around him to the other side)\n",
      "Ross Hey, I was looking out for you.\n",
      "Rachel Oh, really, well Ross, you know what? I am a big girl. I don't need someone telling me what is best for me.\n",
      "Ross I gotta say, I have not had sex a lot of times before, this is the worst ever.\n",
      "Rachel Oh, really, really? Well, it wasn't very good for me either. (She turns to leave and Ross over takes her and stands infront on her, his back to the row of doors leading to the hospital rooms)\n",
      "Ross Hey you know what? You know what? To avoid this little thing in the future, let's just say, you and me, never having sex again.\n",
      "Rachel What?\n",
      "Ross That's right, sex is off the table. (The door starts to open behind him and Dr. Green emerges) I am never having sex with you again. (Rachel stays quiet and after a few moments Ross realizes what has happened. He turns abruptly) Dr. Green, are you feeling better? (Rachel's dad glares at him with a deadly look)\n",
      "Chandler Hey! How was lunch?\n",
      "Erica (To Chandler) We had a good time. By the way, I wanted to ask you something. It would really mean a lot to me, if the baby was a boy, that you name him after my father, Jiminy Billy Bob (Monica smiles at Chandler and his he looks shocked and scared, getting no support from his wife)\n",
      "Chandler (struggling) Oh, really?\n",
      "Erica No! (To Monica) You we're right, that was fun! I'm gonna go finish packing.\n",
      "Chandler O-okay. (steps closer to Monica and speaks softly) So, is she gonna take the test?\n",
      "Monica Nope, she doesn't have to, I found out who the father is.\n",
      "Chandler Oh God. It's shovely-Joe, isn't it?\n",
      "Monica (smiling) No it's not.\n",
      "Chandler How do you know?\n",
      "Erica Well, it turns out that Erica didn't pay much attention in Sex Ed class, because the thing she did with that prison guy... it'd be pretty hard to make a baby that way.\n",
      "Chandler Oh God! What was it? The thing that we hardly ever do or the thing we never do?\n",
      "Monica The thing we never do.\n",

      "Director You really think this man is speaking French?\n",
      "Joey Sa-sa-saw!\n",
      "Phoebe Écoutez, je vais vous dire la vérité. C'est mon petit frère. Il est un peu retardé. (Translation: Listen, I will tell you the truth. He's my little bother. He's a bit retarded.)\n",
      "Phoebe Alors, si vous pouviez jouer le jeu avec lui... (Translation: So, would you please just humor him?)\n",
      "Director (to Joey) Good job, little buddy. That was some really good French. But I think we're gonna go with someone else for the part.\n",
      "Joey Ah. All right. But my French was good?\n",
      "Director It was great.\n",

      "Ross Oh, no problem.\n",
      "Rachel And also, you know I uh, I was thinking about what you said, you know, about the whole sex thing and... it's probably not a great idea to go down that road again.\n",
      "Ross Thank you. I'm glad you agree.\n",
      "Rachel It's a shame though, I mean, when we did it, it was pretty good.\n",
      "Ross Yeah... Yeah, that's true.\n",
      "Rachel Hey uhm, do you remember that one really great time...?\n",
      "Ross Oh, ye-ah!\n",

      "Ross ...Valentine's day...\n",
      "Both (long pause, they realize) Oh yeah!\n",

      "Ross Hmmm-mmmm.\n",
      "Rachel (after a pause) Not even one more time?\n",
      "Ross Not even once.\n",

      "Chandler See? (Does his laugh.) Here we go. (Starts walking her to their room, and has to pass in front of Mr. Geller who’s sitting at the table and Mrs. Geller who’s standing next to him.)\n",
      "Mr. Geller Happy birthday, sweetie! Give us a hug! (Starts to get up.)\n",
      "Mrs. Geller (stopping him) Don’t get up Jack! The safety pins are about to blow.\n",
      "Monica (sees someone) Paul!\n",
      "Chandler (correcting her) Phil.\n",
      "Monica Phil!\n",
      "Chandler Now, there is a dress laid out on your bed. (Monica stumbles on the steps.) Okay, (catches her) you’re doing great. You’re doing great. You’re doing fine.\n",
      "Phoebe Hey, what’s going on?\n",
      "Chandler Monica’s a little drunk.\n",
      "Phoebe Yay! I love drunk Monica!\n",
      "Monica Awwwww… (Giggles.)\n",
      "Chandler (To Monica) Go change! (To Phoebe) She doesn’t want her parents to know she’s drunk.\n",
      "Phoebe Ohh! All right! All right. Here’s what we’ll do, I’ll get twice as drunk as Monica and then no one’s will even notice her.\n",
      "Rachel What’s-what’s going on? Phil’s really pissed!\n",
      "Chandler Monica’s wasted.\n",
      "Ross Maybe that will liven up this party.\n",
      "Chandler (To Rachel) Okay, will you just go help her change please!\n",
      "Rachel Okay, but taking care of a drunk, naked woman seems like a job for Joey.\n",
      "Joey Yep. (Starts for Monica’s room, but Chandler stops him.)\n",
      "Tag (handing his to her) This one’s from me.\n",
      "Rachel Ahh!\n",
      "Tag It wasn’t on your list, but hopefully you’ll think it’s really fun.\n",
      "Rachel (opening it) A scooter! (She’s not happy.)\n",
      "Ross (to Tag) Stick to the list. Always stick to the list.\n",
      "Rachel No! No-no, I love it. Thank you. (Kisses him.)\n",
      "Chandler Okay, open ours next. Open ours next!\n",
      "Rachel Okay.\n",
      "Joey Now that you’re a couple, we don’t get two presents from you guys?\n",
      "Chandler For my last birthday you gave me a hug! (To Rachel) Okay, read the card! Read the card!\n",
      "Rachel Okay. (Opens the card and reads it.) Happy birthday Grandma! It’s better to be over the hill (starting to cry) then buried under it. (Breaks down as everyone glares at them.) All our love Monica and Chandler. (Crying) That’s funny, yeah!\n",
      "Chandler No-no-no-no! That was the joke!\n",
      "Rachel (crying) No, I know! I get it! It’s funny!\n",
      "Chandler No, because you’re not a grandmother!\n",
      "Rachel No I know, because to be a grandmother you have to be married and have children and I don’t have any of those things. That’s why it’s so funny. (Runs into her room crying.)\n",
      "Monica All you had to do was buy the card!\n",
      "Ross Hey! Look who’s back! It’s the birthday girl! How’s the birthday girl feeling?\n",
      "Rachel Well, I feel fine, but I think you’re bumming out the rest of the kids.\n",
      "Ross What? (Glances over and sees the faces of the rest of the group, then goes and sits down.)\n",
      "Rachel Okay! Y’know what? I realized it was stupid to get upset about not having a husband and kids. All I really needed was a plan. See I wanna have three kids…\n",
      "Phoebe Oh let me guess, and you wanna have them all at the same time and you wanna have them for your brother.\n",
      "Rachel As I was saying… I should probably have the first of the three kids by the time I’m 35 which gives me five years. I love this plan! I wanna marry this plan!\n",
      "Phoebe If you could do that, I’d marry the hippity-hop.\n",
      "Rachel So, if I wanna have my kid when I’m 35, I don’t have to get pregnant until I’m 34. Which gives Prada four years to start making maternity clothes! Oh wait, but I do want to be married for a year before I get pregnant…\n",
      "Monica Really! That long?! (Chandler slowly turns and looks at her.) (To Chandler) Look all you want, it’s happening!\n",
      "Rachel No, so I don’t have to get married until I’m 33! That’s three years, that’s three whole years—Oh, wait a minute though. I’ll need a year and a half to plan the wedding, and I’d like to know the guy for a year, year and a half before we get engaged… Which means I need to meet the guy by the time I’m thirty.\n",
      "Ross Which is fine! Because you just turned—(Removes two candles from the cake)—twenty-eight!\n",
      "Rachel No! Ross, no! It is not fine! Eh-eh-according to my plan I should already be with the guy I wanna marry!\n",
      "Joey Will you quit hoggin’ it!\n",
      "Rachel (To Chandler) I’m telling you it’s like watching Bambi learn how to walk.\n",
      "Ross (To Monica) You’re drunk! Mom and dad are gonna be maaaaadd! Maybe I’m a little drunk.\n",
      "Chandler (to a waiter) Oh that’s great! Right there! Can we get some of that over here please? (The waiter comes over) There we go.\n",
      "Joey (to the waiter) Hey! Are those crab cakes? (The waiter nods) Did I not tell ya to come straight to me when more crab cakes were ready?\n",
      "Chandler (To Monica) How are you feeling?\n",
      "Monica You are so handsome! I wanna make love to you right here, right now! (Growls and pulls him into a kiss.)\n",
      "Ross I really wish that you wouldn’t.\n",
      "Chandler (To Monica) Now all you have to do is just get through a little bit more, okay? Then we can put you in bed, okay? Just smile and don’t talk to anyone.\n",
      "Phoebe (clinking two glasses together) Speech! Speech! Let’s hear from the birthday girl! Huh?\n",
      "Chandler Pheebs!!\n",
      "Phoebe Don’t you see? Everyone’s looking at me! The plan’s working! I didn’t even have to take off my top yet!\n",
      "Mrs. Geller Speech! Come on Monica!\n",
      "Ross Come on!\n",
      "All Come on! Speech!\n",
      "Mr. Geller (filming this) Hey Chandler, you can’t keep your hands off her for one second!\n",
      "Mrs. Geller Oh-ho, I think it’s nice.\n",
      "Chandler I think it’s necessary. (Backs away anyhow.)\n",
      "Monica I-I-I wanna thank you all for coming. My family and my friends…\n",
      "Phoebe (screaming) Wooo!! Hoo!!\n",
      "Monica I really like to say that I’m-um… (Pause) Y’know what I’d really like to say? I’m drunk!! (Mrs. Geller pulls the camera down.) That’s right mom and dad your little Harmonica is hammered!! (Ross grabs the camera out of his dad’s hands.) And guess what! I’ve been drunk before! And I’ve smoked a cigarette! And I got a box of Ding-Dongs hidden in my underwear drawer! It’s all okay. It’s okay because I turned thirty today. And, and I can do anything I want! Because I am a grown up. (Falls over sideways with Ross filming the fall.)\n",
      "Phoebe (To Joey) Okay quick, help me get this off! (Motions to her top.)\n",
      "Joey Yeah!!\n",
      "Phoebe I lost a whole year! I can’t believe it! This is so unfair!\n",
      "Joey Oh, I don’t know Pheebs. It’ll be okay.\n",
      "Phoebe Will it? Will it?! I mean, how would you feel if you found out you were 31?\n",
      "Joey That’s not gonna happen. No. (Looks up) Because we have a new deal!\n",
      "Phoebe Plus, it totally ruined my schedule! I…I haven’t done any of the things I wanted to do by the time I was 31!\n"

      "Joey Oh, I don't know…. Yeah, can't do it.\n",
      "Monica What?!\n",
      "Ross Monica, whatever you do, do not drop that ball!\n",

      "Ross 2 hours, 27 minutes.\n",
      "Monica Really?!\n",
      "Monica (on phone, faking she's sick) I-I'm not gonna be able to make it into work today, I don't feel very good. (Joey makes a high throw and Monica has to catch it way over her head.) (Not sounding sick) Yes!! (Realizes what she just did.) (Sounding sick again) Wow! Uh, for a second there I thought I was really better, but I'm not. (Hangs up and keeps throwing the ball.)\n",
      "Ross Hey Rach!\n",
      "Rachel Hey.\n",
      "Ross Check it out! Almost 3 hours without droppin' it!\n",

      "Ross Yeah.\n",

I mean, it's not sweet, it's not cute, I even dragged that little string on the ground, and it just flipped out and scratched the hell out of me.

      "Ross Doesn't sound as crazy as paying a thousand dollars for a cat.\n",

      "Chandler He's a great guy, y'know? And he loves you a lot, you are a very lucky lady.\n",
      "Phoebe You are useless! Freaking out about commitment is the one thing you can do! The one thing! And you can't even do that right! God!\n",
      "Chandler I’m sorry. (Pause) If you ask me, I'd move in with him.\n",
      "Phoebe Ohh!! God! (Gary enters and she sees him) Ooh! (To Chandler) Get out of here, good for nothing.\n",
      "Gary Hey Chandler.\n",
      "Chandler Hey Gar!\n",
      "Gary (To Phoebe) Hi sweetie. (Kisses her.) Hi, can I talk to you for a second?\n",
      "Phoebe Yeah! Okay. (They move to the couch.)\n",
      "Gary You look very pretty today.\n",
      "Phoebe Thanks! Okay. (They sit down.)\n",
      "Gary Here's the thing.\n",
      "Phoebe Yeah?\n",
      "Gary Y'know I really want to move this relationship forward.\n",
      "Phoebe Uh-hmm.\n",
      "Gary Because if you're not moving forward, y'know you're just moving backwards.\n",
      "Phoebe No that's not true. If you're not moving forward, you're just staying still. And staying still is good. Watch this. (She stays still for a brief second.)\n",
      "Gary Phoebe?\n",
      "Phoebe Yeah?\n",
      "Gary I want you to move in with me.\n",
      "Phoebe That is so sweet. But don't you think it's a little too soon? I mean there's so much we don't know about each other.\n",
      "Gary (disappointed) Oh. Oh-oh-okay, I get it.\n",
      "Phoebe I just—I don't want us to jump into something we're not ready for.\n",
      "Gary (disappointed more) Uh-huh.\n",
      "Phoebe I really don't want to mess up what we have. I'm just—I'm worried it's gonna be a big mistake.\n",
      "Gary (on the verge of tears) Yeah.\n",
      "Phoebe Which is why my answer is yes!\n",
      "Gary (suddenly happy) Really?!\n",
      "Phoebe Uh-huh! (They hug.) I'm so…happy. (She's not happy.)\n",
      "Ross (catching the ball) Monica! Stop throwing it so hard! We're on the same team!\n",
      "Chandler Four hours? You guys have been doing this for four hours?\n",
      "Joey That's right baby.\n",
      "Chandler All right, let me in. (He jumps off of the counter to join in the game.)\n",
      "Monica (jumping in front of him) No-no! Don't do it! Don't!\n",
      "Chandler What?\n",
      "Monica He's a dropper!\n",
      "Joey Oh yeah, that's right!\n",
      "Chandler I'm not a dropper!\n",
      "Ross It's really a uh-uh three person game, y'know?\n",
      "Chandler It's throwing and catching!\n",
      "Ross All right. (He gently tosses the ball to Chandler who catches it.)\n",
      "Chandler Oh! Oh! That's so hard. (Starts to juggle the ball, but loses control and almost drops it and hands it to Monica.)\n",
      "Joey Whoa-whoa you guys, it's not a cat!\n",
      "Monica Oh my—Oh good God!\n",
      "Rachel (she's wearing an oven mitt to protect her hand) I give up you guys, I don't know what I'm going to do with this thing!\n",
      "Ross Baking it didn't help, huh?\n",
      "Monica So, why don't you just take it back to where you got it?\n",
      "Rachel I tried! They won't take her back.\n",
      "Chandler Maybe that's because she's a minion of the anti-Christ.\n",
      "Monica Rach, why won't they take it back?\n",
      "Rachel Well, they said would but they would only give me store credit. I mean, what am I going to do, get a thousand regular cats?\n",
      "Monica Look, if you want you can keep it at our place until you find out what to do with it.\n",
      "Rachel No Mon that's not the point. I'm out a thousand dollars, I'm all scratched up, and I'm stuck with this stupid cat that looks like a hand! (Storms out.)\n",
      "Monica Oh my God, the cat's made my eyes water! Don't-don't throw it to me! My vision's been compromised!! (Quickly grabs a tissue to wipe her eyes.) Oh God! Okay. Okay. It's okay. Man, that was close.\n",
      "Chandler Yeah, you almost overreacted to something.\n",
      "Phoebe and Gary (entering) Hey!\n",
      "All Hey!\n",
      "Gary We have great news!\n",
      "Phoebe We're moving in together! Isn't it great! Yay!\n",
      "All Congratulations! Congrats!\n",
      "Phoebe I know, I'm so excited!\n",
      "Gary So am I!\n",
      "Phoebe Well, you're not more excited than I am! No way! I'm the most excited!\n",
      "Gary Okay, I'll see you at the station later.\n",
      "Phoebe Okay, yeah, I'll see you later! Don't forget about the moving in!\n",
      "Gary All right.\n",
      "Monica So you're moving in with him. What happened?\n",
      "Phoebe I couldn't tell him no. He got so sad. Maybe it'll be all right. I do really like him a lot and probably do it eventually anyway and plus, think of all the money I'll save on stamps.\n",
      "Monica Why, do you write him a lot?\n",
      "Phoebe No, I just heard when people live together, they split the cost of stamps. Don't they?\n",
      "All Yeah! That's right. Yeah-yeah! Yeah!\n",
      "Phoebe Oh, I'm sorry, the oven mitts really freaked me out.\n",
      "Gary Hey, honey! Okay, so did you find any apartments? Anything in Brooklyn Heights?\n",
      "Phoebe No, nothing.\n",
      "Gary Oh really?\n",
      "Phoebe Yeah.\n",
      "Gary Nothing at all?\n",
      "Phoebe No, as soon as something opens up we'll move right in. Unless it doesn't have a pool, I need a pool. (Turns away from him.)\n",
      "Gary Phoebe, can I talk to you for a second?\n",
      "Phoebe Uh-huh!\n",
      "Gary Take a seat. You okay? You feeling all right? (Closes the door and takes off his coat.)\n",
      "Phoebe (sits down) Yeah, I feel great. 'Cause we're moving in together.\n",
      "Gary So you uh, you checked the paper for listings in Brooklyn Heights, right? You-you checked the Post?\n",
      "Phoebe Yeah, uh-huh, there was nothing. (Pause) Can I get some water?\n",
      "Gary In a minute. You-you checked today's Post?\n",
      "Phoebe Umm, yeah! Today's.\n",
      "Gary 'Cause uh, this is today's Post (produces one from the other chair) and uh, these are the listings I found. (Points) Brooklyn Heights, two bedroom. (Points) Brooklyn Heights, one bedroom. (Points) Brooklyn Heights, (points) Brooklyn Heights, (points) Brooklyn Heights!\n",
      "Phoebe (looks at the paper) Are these for rent! I thought people were just bragging!\n",
      "Gary Let me tell you what I think might be going on. (Phoebe looks down in shame.) No-no-no, don't look at the table. Look at me. (Points to his eyes and she does so) Okay, I think somebody asked someone to move in with them. And I think someone said, \"Yes\" but now she's having doubts because things are moving to fast for someone. Does that sound at all possible to you?\n",
      "Phoebe Yes. Yes! Fine! I am someone! You want me to say it? I have doubts! (Pause) I'm sorry! (Puts her head down.)\n",
      "Gary Phoebe…\n",
      "Phoebe Yeah?\n",
      "Gary Phoebe, it's okay that you feel this way. I mean it is soon. And there's a lot of things we don't know about each other, and I just figure that everything I really like. And the things I don't know, I get to learn about at someplace with both our names on the mailbox.\n",
      "Phoebe That's so sweet.\n",
      "Gary Sweethart, but none of that matters if it's too soon for you. It's fine! We don't have to move in together. I just—I want you to be happy\n",
      "Phoebe Living with you would make me happy.\n",
      "Gary Phoebe, you don't have to say that.\n",
      "Phoebe No, I really wanna live with you! I wanna move in with you!\n",
      "Gary Are you sure?\n",
      "Phoebe Yes. Definitely! Yes! Let's live in an apartment that we both live in! (Hugs him.)\n",
      "Gary Oh that's great!\n",
      "Phoebe Oh wait, one sec. One sec. (Goes to the mirror) Hey you! Behind the glass! Who are you looking at! I've always wanted to say that when I was in one of these rooms, (sees the look on his face) which was never!\n",
      "Rachel Show cat! Quality show cat! Show cat! (A woman approaches.)\n",
      "Woman No. 1 (looks into the box) Oh my God! What's wrong with your baby?!\n",
      "Rachel It's not a baby! It's a cat!\n",
      "Woman No. 1 Eew! It's creepy looking!\n",
      "Rachel Oh no! No! It's actually—it's very sweet. It's very sweet. Look! (Goes to pet it and it hisses at her.) Yeah, do you want it?\n",
      "Woman No. 1 (laughs) No, I hate cats.\n",
      "Rachel Well, so then what are you doing to me? Okay? Just get out of here! All right? Move on!\n",
      "Woman No. 2 Wow! What an unusual cat!\n",
      "Rachel Yes! Thank you! Exactly! You want it?\n",
      "Woman No. 2 Maybe. I was thinking about getting a cat, I was just going to go to the shelter (Good for her) but… Okay, why not?\n",
      "Rachel Oh, terrific! That'll be $2,000.\n",
      "Woman No. 2 What?!\n",
      "Rachel Okay, a thousand.\n",
      "Woman No. 2 I thought you wanted to adopt your cat.\n",
      "Rachel Well, I do, but you're just gonna have to actually look at this as more of an investment than a cat.\n",
      "Woman No. 2 Okay, yeah, I just wanted a cat. (Starts to leave.)\n",
      "Rachel (makes some unintelligible sound to stop her from leaving) Obviously you know how to haggle, so I'm not gonna try and take you on. Okay? So $800 and I don't call the cops because you're robbing me blind! Blind! (Covers her eyes) Just take cat, leave the money, and run away! Run away! (Uncovers her eyes and sees that the woman has fled) Damnit! (To the cat) Cat, can't you at least smile or something?! (The cat hisses at her again, it sounds like Rachel) Okay, did anybody just hear that? Anybody?\n",
      "Ross I'm starving!\n",
      "Monica Come on guys! Suck it up! We're closing in on ten hours! It's gut-check time!\n",
      "Joey I don't know who made you the boss? All right? We (Ross and him) invented this game!\n",
      "Monica Please! I made this game what it is.\n",
      "Chandler Not fun anymore?\n",
      "Ross I'm still hungry!\n",
      "Monica All right, there's some pizza at my place, we can all eat with one hand right? Are you with me?\n",
      "Ross I am!\n",
      "Monica All right! Let's go! (Runs to the door.) Let's go Team Monica! (The guys all stop and stare at her) All right, we can work out the name later.\n",
      "Monica Rachel! What is your cat doing in one of my bowls!\n",
      "Rachel It's not! I'm defrosting a chicken. (Pause) Oh, I uh sold Mrs. Whiskerson.\n",
      "Ross Oh, thank God!\n",
      "Joey Did you get your money back?\n",
      "Rachel Yeah, 15 hundred dollars.\n",
      "Monica Wow! You made a profit!\n",
      "Gunther (entering with the cat) I just came for the red-velvet pillow.\n",
      "Rachel Oh yeah, there you go. (Hands over the pillow.)\n",
      "Gunther Thanks Rachel. And-and don't forget you-you can come visit her anytime you want.\n",
      "Rachel Oh good, great! I'll-I'll keep that in mind. (Turns and walks away.)\n",
      "Gunther (To Ross) Hey! So what is this? Some kind of snake or something?\n",
      "Gary I really like waking up with you.\n",
      "Phoebe I like waking up with you too. (Looks out the window) Oh! It's such a beautiful morning. (Some birds are singing outside the window) Oh, I can stay here all day.\n",
      "Gary That would be great!\n",
      "Phoebe We could have breakfast in bed…\n",
      "Gary Wait, just a second.\n",
      "Phoebe Okay. (He grabs his gun and shoots the bird.) Oh! Oh no.\n",
      "Monica All right! Come on Monica! Look alive! Come on, look alive!\n",
      "Phoebe (entering) Oh good, you're all up.\n",
      "Rachel Phoebe! It's 6 o'clock in the morning! Why aren't you at Gary's?\n",
      "Phoebe Oh yeah, that's over.\n",
      "All What?!\n",
      "Chandler Come on! Gary's such a great guy! Whatever the problem is, you can work it out!\n",
      "Phoebe He shot a bird!\n",
      "Chandler Oh that is over!\n",
      "All That's terrible! I'm sorry!\n",
      "Rachel Phoebe, are you okay?\n",
      "Phoebe Yeah. Yeah, I'll be alright.\n",
      "Joey Oh hey, here Pheebs. (He throws her the ball.)\n",
      "Phoebe (catches it) Nah, I don't feel like playing. (She sets the ball down on the table and everyone gasps.)\n",
      "Monica It's okay. It's okay. Just pretend that it didn't happen! Okay? No one needs to know! I mean, Phoebe's not an official ballplayer! I mean, only official ballplayers can drop the ball!\n",
      "All All right. Okay. I'm starving! (They all get up, thus officially ending the game.)\n",
      "Rachel Phoebe, honey, wanna get some breakfast?\n",
      "Phoebe Yeah!\n",
      "Monica Okay! Okay, let's race! First one there wins! Ha-ha! (Runs out the door and everyone watches her leave.)\n",
      "Chandler You guys wanna eat here?\n",
      "All Yeah! As long as we're here!\n",
      "Joey Man that was great! Huh? Can you believe how long we threw that ball around?\n",
      "Rachel Yeah, it is amazing it lasted that long.\n",
      "Ross I know. My arm is killing me.\n",
      "Rachel No, I meant with the dropper over here. (Points at Chandler.)\n",
      "Chandler Y'know, how did I get this reputation as a dropper? Okay? I'm anything but a dropper. (We see various scenes of him dropping a football, a mug of coffee, the phone, an apple, a Frisbee, a record, and the final scene has a ball bouncing off of his chest. I'm not going to describe them, you'll have to see them.)\n",

      "Monica Great! Well Rachel, the reason why I won’t let you drive the Porsche is because you’re a terrible driver. There! That wasn’t about the wedding.\n",
      "Ross Look Rach if-if you want to go for a ride in the Porsche I’ll be glad to take you for a quick spin around the block.\n",

      "Chandler Well he doesn’t have to know! It’s not like we run in the same circles. I hang out with you guys, and he stars in a drag show in Vegas.\n",
      "Phoebe Ooh, I think I wanna trade circles.\n",
      "Chandler Trust me, you don’t want him there either. Okay? Nobody is gonna be staring at the bride when the father of the groom is wearing a back-less dress.\n",

      "Monica We’re going to Las Vegas to see your dad. It’s time you two talked, and I want to get to know my father-in-law.\n",
      "Chandler Y’know we already went over this and I won!\n",
      "Monica No you didn’t. Oh and honey just so you know, now that you’re marrying me, you don’t get to win anymore.\n",
      "Chandler Look forget it okay? I don’t want to go. I don’t want to see him. I don’t wanna.\n",
      "Monica Chandler, look I-I know that your dad embarrassed you. I know…\n",
      "Chandler No-no all kids are embarrassed by their parents, you’d have to come up with a whole new word for what I went through. When I was in High School, he used to come to all of my swim meets dressed as a different Hollywood starlet. Y’know it’s hard enough to be fourteen. You’re skinny. You’re wearing speedoes—That your mom promised that you would grow into! And you look up into the stands and there’s your dad cheering you on dressed as Carmen Miranda. We was wearing a headdress with real fruit that he will later hand out to your friends as a healthy snack!\n",
      "Monica Hey, the point is that he was at everyone of your swim meets and he was there cheering you on! Okay? That’s a, that’s a pretty great dad.\n",
      "Chandler He had sex with Mr. Girabaldi!\n",
      "Monica Who’s Mr. Girabaldi?\n",
      "Chandler Does it matter?!\n",
      "Monica Chandler, you’re not fourteen anymore. Okay? Maybe it’s time that you let that stuff go. If your father’s not at your wedding…you’re gonna regret it for the rest of your life.\n",
      "Chandler Yeah o-okay, but I’m just doing this for you.\n",
      "Monica Yes!\n",

      "Joey Pheebs!\n",
      "Phoebe Hey!\n",
      "Joey Listen, you know how uh, when you’re wearing pants and you lean forward I check out your underwear?\n",
      "Phoebe Yeah!\n",
      "Joey Well, when Jake did it I saw that…he was wearing women’s underwear!\n",
      "Phoebe I know. They were mine.\n",
      "Joey Oh. (Laughs.) No! No wait, that’s weird!\n",
      "Phoebe No, it’s not! We were just goofing around and I dared him to try them on.\n",
      "Joey That’s weird!\n",
      "Phoebe I’m wearing his briefs right now.\n",
      "Joey That’s…kinda hot.\n",
      "Phoebe I think so too. And that little flap? Great for holding my lipstick.\n",
      "Joey Yeah, I wouldn’t know about that.\n",
      "Phoebe And! Y’know what Jake says? That women’s underwear is actually more comfortable. And he loves the way the silk feels against his skin.\n",
      "Joey Yeah well next thing you know, he’ll be telling you that your high heels are good for his posture!\n",
      "Phoebe There is nothing wrong with Jake! Okay? He is all man! I’m thinking even more than you.\n",
      "Joey Oh yeah, he looked like a real lumberjack in those pink laceys.\n",
      "Phoebe I’m just saying that only a man completely secure with his masculinity could walk around in women’s underwear! I don’t think you could ever do that.\n",
      "Joey Hey! I am secure with my masculinity.\n",
      "Phoebe Okay whatever.\n",

      "Ross (to the woman checking her mail next to him) Hey!\n",
      "The Man (To Ross) Excuse me. (He puts up a flyer that has a sketch drawing of Joey and it reads, \"Warning! Intruder! If you see this creep - call the cops!\") You should check this out, tell the other tenants. Apparently he's running around looking for some kind of a hot girl.\n",
      "Ross (to the woman checking her mail) Who isn't?\n",
      "Ross I don't, I don't think we've meet. I-I'm Ross.\n",
      "The Hot Girl I know. You're the guy who wouldn't chip in for the handyman.\n",
      "Ross Nevermind! (Goes back to his mailbox.)\n",
      "The Hot Girl No, I-I actually thought it was unfair the way everyone reacted. I mean you had just moved in.\n",
      "Ross I had just moved in. Thank you! Listen umm…\n",
      "The Hot Girl Jen.\n",
      "Ross Jen, I know this may sound a little…(makes some kind of crazy noise) But uh, would you maybe wanna grab a cup of coffee sometime, or…\n",
      "Jen Sure! That would be nice.\n",
      "Ross Umm?\n",
      "Jen Oh! My number is on there. (Hands him a business card.) Give me a call.\n",
      "Ross I will give you a call.\n",
      "Jen I'll see you later. (Starts to walk away.)\n",
      "Ross Okay!\n",
      "Jen I forgot my paper. (Ross quickly hides the card in his mouth.)\n",
      "Chandler That was amazing!\n",
      "Monica Phoebe and Gary are so gonna hear about this at dinner.\n",
      "Chandler That was amazing.\n",
      "Monica We are the hottest! Huh? No one is hotter than we are! You're the best.\n",
      "Chandler No, you're the best.\n",
      "Monica No, you're the best.\n",
      "Chandler No, you're the best.\n",
      "Monica I am the best.\n",
      "Joey (entering) Hey guys! (Sees their state of undress) What 'cha been doin'? (Has a silly grin.)\n",
      "Monica (looking out the window) Hey Joey! Isn't that the girl that waved at you the other day?\n",
      "Joey I don't know. But I can see through your sheet. (He looks out the window.) Yeah, yeah, that's her. But y'know what? Doesn't matter, I'm never gonna get to meet her anyway.\n",
      "Monica Why?\n",
      "Joey Because it's impossible to find her apartment! She lives in some like of hot girl parallel universe, or something.\n",
      "Monica What are you talking about? (Pointing out the window.) She obviously lives on the second floor, seventh apartment from the left!\n",
      "Joey No. No. No. She lives on the third floor, eighth apartment from the left.\n",
      "Monica No, those first two windows, (Points) that's the lobby. And y'know the other one over there, that's the stairway. You've been counting wrong.\n",
      "Joey I did not know that! Thank you Monica. (Starts to leave) I can't believe I almost lost another girl because of counting.\n",
      "Ross So uhh, you ready?\n",
      "Jen Sure, I'll just get my coat. (There's a knock on the door.) Could you get that?\n",
      "Ross Sure. (He opens the door to Joey. Needless to say, Joey's stunned.) Joey…\n",
      "Joey Dahhhhh!! (Ross has a puzzled look on his face.) No! Noooo!! (Storms off.)\n",
      "Rachel Ah, first, I-I would like to say thank you for agreeing to see me again.\n",
      "Mr. Zelner That's quite all right, but I feel obligated to tell you that this meeting is being videotaped.\n",
      "Rachel (looks around for the camera) Okay. Umm, well, first I would like to start by apologizing for kissing you and uh, for yelling at you.\n",
      "Mr. Zelner Fair enough.\n",
      "Rachel Now you're probably going to hire one of the people who did not ah, (She puts her hands on his desk blotter and he moves it. Rachel then doesn't know where to put her hands.) who did, who did not umm, yell at you and storm out, and I think that's a big mistake and here's why. I made a huge fool of myself and I came back, that shows courage. When I thought you wanted sex in exchange for this job, I said no. That shows integrity. And, I was not afraid to stand up for myself and that shows courage. (Suddenly realizes that she said courage twice.) Okay umm, now I know I already said courage, but y'know you gotta have courage. And umm, and finally when I thought you were making sexual advances in the workplace, I said no and I was not litigious. {By the way, litigious means to want to litigate and litigate is to make a lawsuit against.  So she didn't want to sue him.   Don't worry, I had to look it up too.} So there you go, you got, you got (counts them off with her fingers) courage, you got integrity, you got (Pause) courage again, and not litigious. Look Mr…\n",
      "Mr. Zelner Zelner.\n",
      "Rachel Zelner! Right! I knew that! I really, really want this job and I think, I think I would be really good at it.\n",
      "Mr. Zelner Y'know what? I may regret this but uh, I'm going to give you a shot.\n",
      "Rachel (gasps) Oh! You are?\n",
      "Mr. Zelner Um-hmm.\n",
      "Rachel Really? Oh thank you! Oh… Oh, would it be completely inappropriate to give you a hug?\n",
      "Mr. Zelner Yes!\n",
      "Rachel Okay, well then how about a handshake? (She goes to shake his hand but misses and touches his groin.) Oh God I'm sorry! Oh God, I'm sorry! I did not mean to touch that—I mean you there. There. Uhh, okay, so thank-thank you, I'm going to leave now thank you very much uh-huh, thank you so—Hey! I'll see you Monday! (Exits.)\n",
      "Phoebe You tired Chandler?\n",
      "Monica You better believe he's tired, after the day we had! If you know what I mean. You know what I mean?\n",
      "Chandler Honey, the tortilla chips know what you mean.\n",
      "Gary So uh Chandler, you like that badge I got you?\n",
      "Chandler Oh yeah, it's so cool. (He opens his coat and has it pinned to the lining.) Now I gotta go, Officer Bing has gotta, 10-100. (Pause, softly) That's pee-pee. (Heads for the bathroom.)\n",
      "Monica Phoebe, you have a, a twig in your hair.\n",
      "Phoebe Ohh, (laughs) umm, we kinda took a little detour on the way over here.\n",
      "Gary Yeah, we took a little stroll in the park and no one was around, so…\n",
      "Monica You didn't!\n",
      "Phoebe We did! We violated Section 12 Paragraph 7 of the criminal code!\n",
      "Monica The park huh? A public place.\n",
      "Gary Uh-huh.\n",
      "Monica I hear ya. Excuse me for just a second! (Gets up and heads for the bathroom as that annoying Gotta-win-at-all-costs-super-competitive thing kicks in again.)\n",
      "Monica Hi Chandler.\n",
      "Chandler Monica! This is the Men's room! (Pause) Isn't it?\n",
      "Monica Yes it is. You see I've always found the men's bathroom very sexual. Haven't you?\n",
      "Chandler No. And if I did, I don't think we'd be going out. Monica, this is getting ridiculous!\n",
      "Monica Come on, we can't let them win!\n",
      "Chandler Ugh, we have already proved that we are hot! Okay? So why-why are you getting so obsessed about this thing?!\n",
      "Monica Because Phoebe and Gary are in that-can't-keep-their-hands-off-each-other-doing-it-in-the-park phase!\n",
      "Chandler (gasps) So?\n",
      "Monica I feel really sad that we're not…really there anymore.\n",
      "Chandler Oh wow! Is that what this all have been about?\n",
      "Monica Wasn't it a lot more exciting when we were y'know all over each other all the time?\n",
      "Chandler Yeah that was great. That was really great! But to tell you the truth, I'm more excited about where we are right now.\n",
      "Monica Really?\n",
      "Chandler Yeah! I've never been in a relationship that's lasted this long before. Y'know to get past the beginning and still be around each other all the time, I think that's pretty incredible. And the fact that this is happening all with you, yeah I think that's pretty exciting. (Kisses her.)\n",
      "Monica That is so sweet. I know that I was acting a little crazy but umm, I feel the same way.\n",
      "Chandler Yeah?\n",
      "Monica Yeah. (They hug.)\n",
      "Chandler Y'know what I just realized? You just freaked out about our relationship.\n",
      "Monica Did not.\n",
      "Chandler Yes you did! Admit it! You freaked out!\n",
      "Monica Okay, I freaked out a little.\n",
      "Chandler Little?! You freaked out big time! Okay? And I fixed it! We have switched places! I am the relationship and king and you are the crazy, irrational screw up! (Does a dance of joy.) (Monica glares at him.) And now we're back.\n",
      "Rachel (laughs) I cannot believe Ross is buying this!\n",
      "Monica Thank God! I can't watch him anymore!\n",
      "Chandler (entering) You guys ready fore the movies?\n",
      "Rachel Yeah! Oh by the way, thank you for loaning us Pamela and Yasmine.\n",
      "Ross (from his apartment) Man! They cannot get enough! (Makes like he's a robot and waves at the cutouts.)\n",

      "Joey Hey, you can stay with us! We'll take care of ya!\n",

      "Monica Uh, look, Larry honey, umm, I wrote the book on Section 5 and I know that you don't have to wear your hat unless you're in the kitchen.\n",
      "Larry And where is your hat?\n",
      "Monica It's in the kitchen, I'll go get it.\n",
      "Larry Ahh that's the 2 points.\n",
      "Phoebe Hey, you should really read that book you wrote. (To Larry) Wow! You saw the hat in the kitchen and knew that she'd have to go in there hatless to get it. You can have your own health inspector detective show!\n",

      "Rachel Oh, honey, please, no, I can't get started with all that Ross stuff again. I mean, he's gonna screwed up for a looong time. And besides y'know, I don't, I don't go for guys right after they get divorced.\n",
      "Monica Right, you only go for them 5 minutes before they get married.\n",

      "Rachel I don't know! He hasn't called me since that one time when we went out. I see him in the hallway, we flirt, I'm all ha-ha-ha-ha, and nothing.\n",

      "Monica Well, I guess we won't be warming his house.\n",
      "Rachel (laughs) Okay. All right, I see what he's doing! He's not asking me out, because he wants me to ask him out.\n",
      "Monica And you're not gonna do that.\n",
      "Rachel That's right! 'Cause that would give him the control! So now he's all ooh, coming up with this whole I've got a party thing y'know, trying to get me to hint around for an invitation. Blew up in his face, didn't it?\n",
      "Monica So-so there is no party.\n",
      "Rachel No, there's a party. There's a party. But the power, that is still up for grabs. You follow me?\n",
      "Monica I think so. Se, he-he's not inviting you to his party because he likes you.\n",
      "Rachel Exactly.\n",
      "Joey Ross?\n",
      "Ross (entering from the bathroom) Hey roomies!\n",
      "Chandler Love what you've done with the place.\n",
      "Ross Oh, yeah I know, I know, it's a lot of boxes, but again I really appreciate you guys letting me stay here.\n",
      "Joey Not a problem. And listen, hey! Since you're gonna be here for a while, why don't—I was thinking we uh, put your name on the answering machine.\n",
      "Chandler Oh yeah!\n",
      "Ross Oh, I uh, hope you don't mind, I kinda uh, jazzed it up a little. Check this out. (He plays the greeting, and We Will Rock You starts to play and Ross's voice comes over it.) We will, we will, call you back!\n",
      "Joey Hey, all right!\n",
      "Ross Pretty cool, huh?\n",
      "Joey (To Chandler) You're fake laughing too, right?\n",
      "Chandler Oh, the tears are real.\n",

      "Phoebe (laughing) You are just nonstop!\n",
      "Larry (coming back) We're outta here!\n",
      "Phoebe Why?!\n",
      "Larry Just walking past the kitchen I saw 10 violations! I'm shutting this place down!\n",
      "Phoebe (awed) You have the power to do that?\n",
      "Larry This does. (Shows her his badge.)\n",
      "Phoebe (excited) Shut it down.\n",
      "Joey Hey.\n",
      "Chandler What are you doing?\n",
      "Joey Nothing.\n",
      "Chandler You built a fort didn't ya?\n",

      "Joey Dude, you should've gone out once and a while.\n",
      "Chandler I hate this thing!\n",
      "Joey Come on, Chandler, Ross is our friend. He needs us right now, so why don't you be a grown up and come and watch some TV in the fort!\n",
      "Rachel Oh, hi Danny.\n",
      "Danny Hey guys, I just uh, wanted to invite you to the party tomorrow night.\n",
      "Monica Oh, thanks! We'll try to stop by.\n",
      "Rachel Uh, actually, I think I'm gonna be busy.\n",
      "Monica You are?\n",
      "Rachel Yeah! Remember I got that uh, gala.\n",
      "Danny Yeah, what's the gala for?\n",
      "Rachel It's a uh, regatta gala.\n",
      "Danny Really! You-you sail?\n",
      "Rachel No-no, but I support it.\n",

      "Monica Okay.\n",
      "Danny Take care. (Leaves.)\n",
      "Rachel Okay. (Closes the door.) Walked right into that one didn't he?\n",
      "Monica What one? You wanted him to invite you to the party and he did it!\n",
      "Rachel Yeah, but he waited until the last minute! So if I said yes, he would know I had nothing better to do than wait around for an invitation to his stupid party. I said, \"No!\" Which puts me right back in the driver seat.\n",
      "Monica Great. So the ball is in his court?\n",
      "Rachel Ball? There is no ball.\n",
      "Ross (glaring at him) Joey, please! (Motions to his computer.)\n",

      "Chandler (entering) Hello children!\n",
      "Joey Hey! Wanna play some foosball? Please?\n",
      "Chandler Okay. (Starts to head for where the foosball table usually is.)\n",
      "Joey No-no, no! We have to move the table into my room, yeah! 'Cause of all the boxes. Come on!\n",
      "Joey All right, I have one question. What is the deal with this? (Imitates Ross's 'quiet down' maneuver, but does move his hands up and down he just flaps his hands as if he's waving good-bye.)\n",
      "Chandler Bye-bye little puppet Joey hand?\n",
      "Joey No, the quiet down thing!\n",
      "Chandler You mean this. (Does the maneuver perfectly.)\n",
      "Joey Um-hmm! Look, I-I-I don't know how much more of this I can take! Did you know he taped over my Baywatch tape with some show about bugs! My God! What if that had been porn?\n",
      "Chandler (gasps) All right look, y'know, this maybe tough but come on, this is Ross! I survived college with him!\n",
      "Joey All right, I guess I can hold out a little longer. Let's have a game.\n",
      "Chandler Okay.\n",
      "Chandler No-no-no-no!\n",
      "Joey YES!!\n",
      "Ross (entering) Uh fellas, (Does the maneuver and gives them a double thumbs up, which Chandler returns as he closes the door.)\n",
      "Chandler Okay, so he's out of here.\n",
      "Joey Um-hmm.\n",
      "Joey (entering) Hey!\n",
      "Monica Hey!\n",
      "Joey You guys got anything to eat? I just went down to Johnos for some chicken and it was closed!\n",
      "Phoebe Oh, I took Larry there to eat but it was all violated. So we shut it down!\n",
      "Joey Pheebs, if this guy keeps closing down all of our favorite places, where are we gonna eat?!\n",
      "Monica I don't know, clean places?\n",
      "Joey Umm, yum!\n",
      "Monica (looking through the peephole) It's Danny.\n",
      "Rachel Don't let him in! I'm supposed to be at a regatta gala.\n",
      "Monica (to Danny) We'll be right there! (To Rachel) Can't you just say it starts later?\n",
      "Rachel What? What kind of a regatta gala starts at night?!\n",
      "Monica The fake kind!\n",
      "Danny Hey, hi, I need a ladle. You got a ladle?\n",
      "Monica We have a ladle. (Gives him one.)\n",
      "Danny Thanks, see you at the party.\n",
      "Monica Okay, great!\n",
      "Phoebe Hey, guys, you know what Larry would say? He would say, \"See you ladle.\" (Laughs.)\n",
      "Chandler Well, I-I-I'm done with this. You want anything Ross? Sports? International? Apartment listings?\n",
      "Ross I'll take sports.\n",
      "Joey Mine! (He grabs it.)\n",
      "Ross All right. Uhh, international.\n",
      "Joey Oh that's mine too! (Grabs it and Ross looks at him.) I'm Italian!\n",
      "Ross Well, I guess I can check out those apartment listings, even though there's never anything in here.\n",
      "Chandler Not even on page 7?\n",
      "Ross (looks) Oh yeah! You're—hey, you're right! Here's an affordable place, (reading ad) two bedroom, close to work, ooh, it's available in five weeks!\n",
      "Chandler What about that circled one?\n",
      "Ross Oh, I-I don't know, it's kind of expensive for a studio.\n",
      "Joey But it's available now! Isn't it?\n",
      "Chandler Yes, it is.\n",
      "Joey Hey, let's go look at it! (They both jump up.)\n",
      "Ross Okay, let's go.\n",
      "Joey Okay!\n",
      "Chandler There we go!\n",
      "Ross Oh-oh-ooh, hey guys, I was wondering if you guys would uh, maybe chip in on some new air filters for the air purifier? I mean after all, we all are using it.\n",
      "Chandler Let's go quicker.\n",
      "Joey Yeah!\n",
      "Ross Oh my God! (Looking around, which doesn't take him long.)\n",
      "Chandler Yeah, well look at this kitchen, slash bathroom. Well that's great! Y'know so you can cook while in the tub.\n",
      "Joey Somebody was using his head. Hey, let's check out the rest of the place.\n",
      "Ross I think this is it. I don't know, maybe we should keep looking.\n",
      "Joey But hey, Ross, this place is available now!\n",
      "Chandler Yeah, you don't want to be stuck with us for the next five weeks.\n",
      "Joey Yeah.\n",
      "Ross (To Joey) So, you-you think I should go ahead and take this place?\n",
      "Joey Oh, it's perfect!\n",
      "Ross (To Chandler) How about you?\n",
      "Chandler It's a kitchen slash bathroom.\n",
      "Ross All right, I see what you guys are saying. I'll uh, I'll go downstairs and fill out an application.\n",
      "Chandler We are bad people.\n",
      "Joey He knew we were trying to get rid of him. He knew! (Pause.) You think we could get a bathtub in our kitchen?\n",
      "Larry (entering) Hey, ready for dinner?\n",
      "Phoebe Ooh, absolutely!\n",
      "Larry Great! How about you wanted to go the Italian place down on Bleaker Street right?\n",
      "Phoebe Ooh, I love that place! (Thinks about it.) So, no.\n",
      "Larry How about Mama Lisettie's?\n",
      "Phoebe Enh. Sure!\n",

      "Phoebe Oh, no-no, this place is totally healthy! That—this milk is mine. I bought this today, 'cause I was thirsty for milk, y'know. (She takes a swig of it, but has to turn away from him as she makes a face to show that it has gone bad.) Okay, let's go!\n",
      "Larry Hey, buddy! (Flashes his badge.) Are you familiar with Section 11-B of the Health Code that requires all refuse material out the back exit?\n",
      "Gunther But then I'd have to go all the way around the dry cleaner place.\n",
      "Larry Oh, so you're saying you'd choose convenience over health?!\n",
      "Phoebe Okay, stop! Larry, okay, can't you just be Larry and not Larry the health inspector guy? Y'know I mean it was really exciting at first but now it's like, okay, so where are we gonna eat ever?\n",
      "Larry Well, I suppose I could give him a warning.\n",
      "Phoebe Thank you. (To Gunther, who's standing there frozen) Okay, go! Go! Go! (He runs off.) (To Larry) Now, if after dinner you still really need to bust someone, I know a hot dog vendor who picks his nose.\n",

      "Joey Hello! (Listens.) Oh yeah! (To Chandler) It's the apartment manager; Ross put us down as references. (To the apartment manager.) Ross is the greatest guy you'll ever meet! Yeah, he's very reliable.\n",
      "Chandler (grabbing the phone) Of course he has this big huge dog! That uh, barks into the night. (Listens.) Well, who doesn't love dogs? (Thinks.) Ah, he's a tap dancer! (Listens.) Yes, some would say that is a lost art. (Thinks.) He's a pimp! (Listens.) There you go! Yes, he's a pimp. He's a big, tap dancing pimp! (Pause.) Hello?\n",

      "RYAN Chicken or small?\n",
      "PHOEBE Chicken. Which is so ironic considering I'm a vegetarian.\n",
      "RYAN Why aren't you at home in bed?\n",

      "PHOEBE Ohh, ohh.\n",
      "RYAN If I had one wish, it would be to build a time machine, go back to when I was 7, when Jimmy Hauser had the chicken pox. I would grab that kid and rub him all over my face.\n",
      "PHOEBE Yeah, or you know, you could just wish that I didn't have them now.\n",
      "RYAN Can I please see your face?\n",
      "PHOEBE Nope. You don't want to see a face covered with pox.\n",
      "RYAN Your face could be covered with lochs, I wouldn't care.\n",
      "PHOEBE And you hate fish. Oh. That's so sweet, alright. Ok, alright, you can see. This is me... [she unveils herself right as a huge lightning bolt crashes outside. Ryan screams in terror.] Oh, I am scary.\n",
      "RYAN Sorry, the lightning. Lightning was an unfortunate incidence. You look lovely, lovely.\n",
      "PHOEBE I hate this. 'Cause I tell you, I had the most amazing two weeks planned for us, and almost everything I had in mind, we had to be a lot closer than this.\n",
      "RYAN Phoebe, I have spent the last eight months in a steel tube with men, thinking about this moment. I am not gonna let a bunch of itchy spots stand between us. [He walks to her and kisses her.]\n",

      "JOEY Hey and everbody is so nice. I just had a good talk with that lady with the red hair, Jeannie.\n",
      "CHANDLER Jeannie, the head of east coast operations Jeannie?\n",
      "JOEY Yeah, turns out our kids go to the same school. Small world huh?\n",
      "CHANDLER Weird world. Your kids?\n",
      "JOEY I figure my character has kids.\n",
      "CHANDLER Ya know there isn't a part of that sentence I don't need explained.\n",
      "JOEY Well, see when you're acting you need to think about stuff like that. My character, Joseph the processor guy, has two little girls, Ashley and Brittany. Ashley copies everything Brittany does.\n",
      "CHANDLER Well, invisible kids can be that way sometimes.\n",
      "JOEY Yeah. Joseph and his wife, Karen, are thinking of having a third kid... Ya know what? Just did.\n",
      "CHANDLER Really? Wow. That's some pretty powerful imaginary sperm you must have there.\n",
      "RYAN You know what makes the itching even worse?\n",
      "PHOEBE That you don't stop talking about it.\n",
      "RYAN Fine.\n",
      "PHOEBE Let's just play, ok. Good, ok. [She picks up the dice.] Here we go, double sixes, here we go... [She starts to rub the dice all over herself.] Here we go, come to mama, just getting ready to roll the dice...\n",
      "RYAN What're you doing? Are you scratching?\n",
      "PHOEBE No. This is what I do for luck, ok.\n",
      "RYAN You're scratching. Give me the dice.\n",
      "PHOEBE No.\n",
      "RYAN Give me the dice.\n",
      "PHOEBE No. Here. [Throws them on the table.] There. Ooh, double sixes.\n",
      "RYAN We can't scratch. You know we can't, we'll scar.\n",
      "PHOEBE Uhh, I can't stop thinking about it. It's just so hard. I just wanna grab all these houses and rub 'em all over my body. [Grabs a handful of the houses.]\n",
      "RYAN No.\n",
      "PHOEBE Give it.\n",
      "RYAN No.\n",
      "PHOEBE Yeah, come on. You know you want it, you know you want it too, come on. Let's just be bad, it'll feel so good. [She starts scratching him.]\n",
      "RYAN Oh God help me.\n",
      "PHOEBE Now do me, do my back. Oh come on, harder.\n",
      "RACHEL Oh, stop that, stop that right now.\n",
      "ROSS You know, I might have expected this of you Phoebe, but Ryan, you're a military man.\n",
      "JOEY You and Milton have to join us on the boat. Karen'll pack a lunch, you'll bring the kids, we'll make a day of it.\n",
      "JEANNIE Oh, that sounds lovely. We're gonna have to set that up. Oh, I better get back. Hope the baby feels better.\n",
      "JOEY Oh, thanks, thanks. Bye bye Jeannie.\n",
      "JEANNIE Bye bye Joey.\n",
      "JOEY What a phony.\n",
      "CHANDLER Well, I'm sure you'll teach her a lesson when she steps off the dock onto nothing. Hey Mr. Douglas.\n",
      "JOEY Sir.\n",
      "MR. DOUGLAS Uh, listen Bing, I received your memo. So, we're not gonna receive the systems report until next Friday?\n",
      "CHANDLER Well the people in my group wanna spend the holiday weekend with their families.\n",
      "MR. DOUGLAS I have a family, I'm gonna be here.\n",
      "JOEY Yeah Bing, what's that about?\n",
      "CHANDLER It's about cutting my people a little slack, ya know, for morale. Look, if you wanna see some rough numbers, I can get them to you by Wednesday.\n",
      "MR. DOUGLAS Rough numbers?\n",
      "JOEY This company was not built on rough numbers. Am I right Mr. Douglas.\n",
      "MR. DOUGLAS Have the final numbers on my desk by Tuesday.\n",
      "CHANDLER Uh, if you say so sir.\n",
      "JOEY Joseph's good, isn't he?\n",
      "CHANDLER Well, I'm going to kill you.\n",

      "CHANDLER Why?\n",
      "JOEY Look, I'm sorry but that's what Joseph does, ok. If you try to pull somethin', he'll call you on it. 'What're you tryin' to pull,' he'll say.\n",
      "RICHARD Ooh, duct tape. Was I supposed to bring something too?\n",

      "MONICA It's for their own good.\n",
      "RICHARD You know, I like the way you have efficiently folded this tab under. See in a tape emergency you could shave valuable seconds off your time.\n",
      "MONICA Exactly. Oh, I love that I can be totally neurotic around you now. Tell me the truth. Don't you like it better now that everything on your desk is perpendicular?\n",
      "RICHARD If it's not a right angle, it is a wrong angle.\n",
      "MONICA Very good.\n",
      "RICHARD Thank you.\n",
      "MONICA You know what. Tomorrow I'm gonna do your clocks.\n",
      "RICHARD You're gonna do what to my clocks.\n",
      "MONICA I'm gonna set them to my time.\n",
      "RICHARD Well, I'm confused. I thought we shared time.\n",
      "MONICA No no. See, in my bedroom I set my clock six minutes fast. You wanna know why?\n",
      "RICHARD Because it's in a slightly different time zone than the kitchen.\n",
      "MONICA No forget it, I'm not gonna tell you now.\n",

      "MONICA No. See you don't understand.\n",

      "RICHARD Yeah.\n",
      "MONICA Alright, well tell me one of yours.\n",
      "RICHARD Ok. Ahh. One of my things is, I always separate my sweat socks from my dress socks.\n",
      "MONICA What if they get mixed up?\n",
      "RICHARD Boy I would just uh, I would freak out.\n",
      "MONICA You would not. I can't believe this. I hate this, you're too normal. I can't believe my boyfriend doesn't have a thing. My boyfriend doesn't have a thing.\n",
      "RICHARD See, if anyone overheard that, I didn't come off well.\n",
      "JOEY Hey. Mr. Douglas is looking for you.\n",
      "CHANDLER Why? Wh- wh- why is Mr. Douglas looking for me?\n",
      "JOEY 'Cause he has a strong suspicion that you dropped the ball on the Lender project.\n",
      "CHANDLER Wha- wh- why, why, why does he suspect that?\n",
      "JOEY Becasue at first he thought it was Joseph. But after he asked Joseph about it, turns out it was you. Anyway, I just thought you should know.\n",
      "CHANDLER Alright, that's it. Look Joey, I'm sorry, I realize this is the role of a lifetime for ya, and if I could just fire Joseph, I would, but unfortunately that's not possible so I'm gonna have to let both of you go.\n",
      "JOEY What're you talking about, everybody loves Joseph.\n",
      "CHANDLER I don't, I hate Joseph, ok. I think he's a brown-nosing suck up.\n",
      "JOEY Oh yeah. Well you can't fire Joseph. You know why, 'cause he's not in your department.\n",
      "CHANDLER Alright, ok, alright. So I can't fire Joseph but uh, I can sleep with his wife.\n",
      "JOEY Karen.\n",
      "CHANDLER Yeah, Karen. I'm thinking about having an affair with her. Oh, you know what? I just did.\n",
      "JOEY Ahh. What the hell are you doing to me man.\n",
      "CHANDLER Oh well it's not me, it's my character, Chandy. Yeah the rogue processor who seduces his co-worker's wives for sport and then laughs about it the next day at the water cooler. In fact, I have her panties right there in my drawer.\n",
      "JOEY Really?\n",
      "CHANDLER No freakshow, she's fictional.\n",
      "JOEY Take it easy. If it means that much to you, I'll uh, I'll go find something else.\n",
      "CHANDLER Thank you.\n",
      "JOEY It's just that, I, I'm gonna miss Joseph. I liked him. His wife, she was hot. [Chadler pushes him out the door by the face.]\n",
      "PHOEBE Can I please take these off? I swear I won't scratch.\n",
      "RACHEL No sorry hon, Monica's orders.\n",
      "RYAN [Comes out of the bathroom, also with oven mits on his hands.] Well that wasn't easy.\n",
      "ROSS Ok, dinner's on.\n",
      "RACHEL And there's a peach cobbler warming in the oven so the plate's gonna be hot but that shouldn't be a problem for you.\n",
      "ROSS Alright you kids, bye now.\n",
      "PHOEBE and RYAN Bye. [waving]\n",
      "ROSS Oh look, a low budget puppet show.\n",
      "PHOEBE It's such a shame you can't see which finger I'm holding up.\n",
      "RYAN Wine?\n",
      "PHOEBE Please. [Ryan pulls the cork with his teeth and spits it into Phoebe's mits.]\n",
      "RYAN Oh, I spilled some.\n",
      "PHOEBE I got it. [Wipes it up with her mits.]\n",
      "RYAN [Puts his hands over Phoebe's ears.] I must tell you, you look beautiful tonight.\n",

      "Chandler What are you going to do?\n",
      "Joey I guess I'm going to have to come up with a really good reason why I wasn't there. The producers are going to be so mad at me. They sat us all down yesterday and said \"Everyone has to be there at 6:00 AM sharp, that means you Tribbiani.\" Like.. like I was some kind of idiot.\n",

      "Ross Don't say that.\n",
      "Amy Oh. I was so looking forward to this. It was going to be such a beautiful Thanksgiving. We were going to have sushi.\n",
      "Rachel Oh Amy, don't cry Amy.  Um.. Ross, could I talk to you in private?\n",
      "Ross Sure, you want to go upstairs?\n",
      "Rachel Um look I was thinking.. If its ok with Monica I would like to invite Amy to Thanksgiving.\n",
      "Ross You know, I think thats a great idea. It'll be like the pilgrims bringing the Indians syphilis.\n",
      "Rachel Look I know she's a little tough to take. She has no where else to go, and she's my sister. Alright, she's Emma's aunt. And I would like them to bond.\n",
      "Ross Ok, fine, but I don't want them bonding to much. I don't want her telling Emma she needs a nose job.\n",
      "Rachel Ross, you know what? She may need one..We're just going to have to make our peace with that!\n",
      "Rachel opens their door Hi.\n",
      "Everyone there says Hi, hey.\n",

      "Phoebe shakes her hand and says Phoe-Be.\n",
      "Amy Oh. That's a funny noise.\n",
      "Joey Pheebs, I still need some help here\n",
      "Phoebe Oh right, ok um. Ok so its not just the lie you tell. but its the way you tell it. . For example if you look down at the ground when you're talking, people know you're lying.\n",
      "Joey Oh.. I don't know why this is so hard for me. you know.. I mean lying is basically just acting and I am a terrfic actor.\n",
      "Phoebe looks down You are a terrific actor.\n",
      "Amy coming out of the bathroom Hey. Hey where's the baby?\n",
      "Rachel Oh we just put her down for a nap.\n",
      "Amy Oh I was just thinking. You know what would be incredible? If you guys died.\n",
      "Ross first has a look of 'huh' then changes it to sarcastic happy Thank you Amy.\n",
      "Amy no, no, then I would get the baby. I mean you know it would be just like a movie. Like at first I wouldn't know what to do with her, then I would rise to the occasion and and then I would get a makeover and then I'd get married.\n",
      "Phoebe Thats a great movie. <she claps>\n",
      "Amy Now listen, not that you guys could stop me or anything cause you know you'd be dead. I was thinking about changing her name. I'm just not really a big fan of Emily. [Transcriber note: I'm surprised that Rachel and Ross didn't say they weren't either here]\n",
      "Ross Emma.\n",
      "Amy turns around to Phoebe Emma, Ross wants you.\n",
      "Phoebe PHOE-BE.\n",
      "Amy turns to Ross and Rachel Why does she keep making that noise?\n",
      "Rachel Honey, I don't know how to tell you this, but um, if something were to happen to Ross or to myself <Ross and Rachel knock on wood> um you wouldn't get the baby.\n",
      "Amy Well who would?\n",
      "Ross Well we haven't offically asked them yet, but we would want Monica and Chandler.\n",
      "Chandler I can't believe you'd want us to raise Emma.\n",
      "Monica yeah oh my god, I'm so moved.\n",
      "Amy I don't believe this, hold on a second. You guys die and I don't get your baby?\n",
      "Rachel See look Amy, we're a lot closer to Monica and Chandler. We see them every day. And truthfully honey, you don't seem very connected to the baby.\n",
      "Amy Connected? I mean.. to what? She's.. she's  a lump.\n",
      "Chandler You know, guys I got to say. This means so much to me. That you would trust me with your child. I mean, we all know that Monica and I have been trying to have a baby of our own. You know I've had my doubts about my skills as a father, but that you two.. that you two.... <starts to cry>\n",
      "Amy <points to Chandler> This guy? Seriously?\n",
      "Monica Okay! It's time for dinner. Everyone we're using our fancy china.. um and its very expensive so please be careful.\n",
      "Ross starts playing with a plate Woah. Woah... <nearly really drops the plate and more seriously> Woah.\n",
      "Monica Okay, just to be clear comedy with the plates will not be well recieved. <pinches Ross' arm>\n",
      "Joey Hey! How come my plate's less fancy then everyone else's? Do you not trust me with a fancy plate?\n",
      "Monica No, honey, its. thats a special plate.  See its a game, whoever gets that plate wins.\n",
      "Joey I can't believe I won.\n",
      "Amy Its such a slap in the face. I'm your sister and you would give your baby to these strangers over me.\n",
      "Rachel Monica is Ross' sister.\n",
      "Amy No, Ross' sister was really fat.\n",
      "Monica That was me.\n",
      "Amy No, she was this really dorky girl in high school that used to follow Rachel around like a puppy dog.\n",
      "Rachel Hey. Amy. You've got to stop doing that.\n",
      "Monica about to have a heart attack Okay, listen I know you're having a little bit of a family crisis, but you don't have to take it out on the plates. I mean, I mean in fact I think that everyone should cut their food like this.\n",
      "Monica Now see, this way you protect the plate.. and lets face it you have fun.\n",
      "Amy Okay, how about this, you guys die and the crazy plate lady dies, then do I get the baby?\n",
      "Chandler No, if crazy plate lad.. <sees Monica frustrated at this comment> If Monica dies then I would get Emma, Right?\n",
      "Rachel Well actually...\n",
      "Chandler Actually what?\n",
      "Ross well.. its just. its just in that case, then um. Emma would go to my parents.\n",
      "Chandler What?\n",
      "Amy Hurts, doesn't it?\n",
      "Joey raises his hand Uh.. who has to die for me to get her?\n",
      "Chandler So if Monica's not around, then I'm not good enough to raise Emma?\n",
      "Ross looks down No,  that that is not what we're saying.\n",
      "Joey Yeah he's lying. He looked down.\n",
      "Chandler Well what is wrong with me? Am I .. am I incomptent? Because I managed to survive whatever it is that killed the three of you!\n",
      "Rachel Honey, you're taking this the wrong way. We think you're going to be a wonderful parent. It's just.. you're more the fun parent.\n",
      "Ross Yeah and we'd want to make sure Emma has someone like Monica who is more uh. uh discliplinarin.. someone who can be firm and strict.\n",
      "Monica Thats not how you see me, is it?\n",
      "Phoebe while cutting a sweet potatoe in the air No you're all about the fun.\n",
      "Chandler Look, I may not know a lot about babies, but do you really think I'm not capable?\n",
      "Ross No, you both are equally capable. Its just.. you're strongest when.. when you're together.\n",
      "Chandler Ok. So if we both had Emma and I die <knocks on table>  she'd have to give her up.\n",
      "Ross Sure, Monica would have to give her up.\n",
      "Joey I lie better then that, right?\n",
      "Chandler So.. let me get this straight. So my two friends die, I get Emma. Then my wife dies, then Emma the one tiny ray of hope left in my life gets taken away from me?\n",
      "Phoebe There's your movie! <claps>\n",
      "Monica Hey. There you are. You disappeared after dinner.\n",
      "Chandler Oh? Did somebody miss me? Is there a child to raise poorly?\n",
      "Monica Ross and Rachel don't know what they're talking about. I mean its not like their so responsible. Emma is a product of a bottle of Merlot and a five year old condom.\n",
      "Chandler Yeah but they're right. I mean, I'm not a strong father figure and I never will be.\n",
      "Monica No you learn these things. You grow into it.\n",
      "Chandler Yeah, but its not who I am. Everything they said was exaclty why I was worried about having a kid. And its true. And look everybody knows it.\n",
      "Monica I don't know it! I want to have a kid with you because I think you're going to be an amazing dad... at the fun parts and the hard parts.\n",
      "Chandler Oh yeah, well can you picture me saying \"Go to your room! You're grounded\"?\n",
      "Monica Can you hear me say \"You're grounded\"?\n",
      "Chandler You said that to me last week.\n",
      "Monica How hard is it? No shoes on the furniture.\n",
      "Joey groans and gets off the phone The producer from Days left a message on my machine asking why I wasn't at the parade. They said everybody's pissed off at me.. <whiny voice> And they all got to meet Santa!\n",
      "Phoebe It's ok. I thought of the perfect lie for you. It's easy to remember and doesn't invite a lot of questions. You weren't at the parade because you had a family emergency.\n",
      "Joey Oh, I like that, yeah. Wasn't at the parade because I had a family emergency.\n",
      "Phoebe Ooh, what happened?\n",
      "Joey all nervous and looking down and fiddling with his ear Oh.. My sister's raccoon.\n",
      "Phoebe No! Nothing with a raccoon.\n",
      "Joey Arg... Alright, I'll take care of it. <throws hands out in the air>\n",
      "Monica Oh wait.. What are you doing?\n",
      "Joey Setting the table.\n",
      "Phoebe Yeah we thought it would be nice to use the fancy china for dessert too.\n",
      "Monica Oh how nice. Maybe later we can all go blow our noses on my wedding dress.\n",
      "Ross Hey dude, you okay? Sorry about before.\n",
      "Chandler Oh no thats okay, you're totally right. I don't know anything about disciplining a child. But it did hurt my feelings and I want you to know that when I die, you don't get Joey.\n",
      "Amy walks over to the couch and sits down next to Rachel Ucch.  <pauses> Uchh <louder this time> In case you hadn't noticed, I'm not talking to you.\n",
      "Rachel UCHH! <much louder and longer then Amy's>\n",
      "Amy You know.. this.. this is classic Rachel.\n",
      "Rachel Yeah.. yeah right.. Remember in high school when I died and didn't give you my baby?\n",
      "Amy This might be my one chance to have a baby Rachel. I mean, you know that I have been so busy focusing on my carrer.\n",
      "Rachel What? What carrer?\n",
      "Amy Um.. I'm a decorator.\n",
      "Rachel Ok. You decorate dad's office and so now you're a decorator. Okay! I went to the zoo yesterday and now I'm a koala bear.\n",
      "Amy Why can't you ever be supportive?\n",
      "Rachel Sup.. You want to talk supportive? You didn't even come and visit me when I was in the hospital having the baby.\n",
      "Amy Oh. Yeah. Well.. You didn't come see me when I was in the hospital when I was getting my lips done.\n",
      "Rachel I did the first time! Oh. Oh.. <gets up and walks into the kitchen> And you know what. You want to know why I'm not giving Emily to you.\n",
      "Ross Emma.\n",
      "Rachel turns to Ross Oh whose side are you on? <back to Amy> I'm not giving you Emma because there is no way you could handle the responibility of a child.\n",
      "Amy How hard could it be? You do it.\n",
      "Joey ooh oooh..\n",
      "Amy Do you want to know why you don't want  me to have the baby?\n",
      "Rachel uh huh.\n",
      "Amy Because you don't want me to be happy. You.. you have always been jealous of me.\n",
      "Rachel Jealous of what? Of your lack of responsiblity? You, your immaturity? Your total disregard of other people's feelings?\n",
      "Amy Uh.. To name a few.  You know.. You know.. You've just always been like this. You just have to have everything. And I couldn't have anything. Like in junior high, when you stole Timmy from me. I mean, do you even realize how much that hurt me?\n",
      "Rachel Timmy was my boyfriend and you made out with him!\n",
      "Amy Oh come on, that was 20 years ago. Get over it.\n",
      "Rachel I cannot, I cannot believe that I invited you here today.\n",
      "Amy Yeah, well you know what I cannot believe. That my so-called sister, gets a 30% discount from Ralph Lauren and I still have to pay retail.\n",
      "Rachel ah ha ha. ah ha ha. <evil meancing laughter> It's forty five.\n",
      "Amy You bitch. You just think you're so perfect. With your new baby and your, your small apartment. <directs this to Ross who in turns throws the towel in his hand down on the table> Well let me tell you something. Your baby isn't even that cute.\n",
      "Ross walks over Too far, Amy. Too far.\n",
      "Rachel You take that back.\n",
      "Amy No.\n",
      "Rachel Take it back!\n",
      "Amy No! What are you going to do? Make me?\n",
      "Rachel Heey man, I work out.\n",
      "Amy So do I.\n",
      "Rachel I do pilates.\n",
      "Amy I do yoga.\n",
      "Rachel Bring it on!\n",
      "Monica Put the plates in the boxes!! Put the plates in the boxes!\n",
      "Rachel Did you just push me?\n",
      "Amy Uh, yeah I think I did.\n",
      "Rachel Alright. Thats it! <Pushes Amy back>\n",
      "Monica screaming at Ross Forget the bubblewrap! There isn't time!\n",
      "Rachel starts messing up Amy's hair Frizzy frizzy frizzy frizzy!!\n",
      "Phoebe Oh my god! Shouldn't we stop this?\n",
      "Joey What? Are you out of your mind? Lets throw some jello on them.\n",
      "Rachel Ew! Gross.\n",
      "Chandler Alright! That is it. This is our apartment and you can not behave this way. Now if you can't act your age then you shouldn't be here at all. Now those plates may not be as nice as the pretty pink ones I picked out, but they're very important to Monica. I want you to apologize to her right now.\n",
      "Amy I'm sorry.\n",
      "Rachel Mon, I'm so sorry.\n",
      "Chandler Okay. Thats better. Now I want you to both apologize to each other and mean it.\n",
      "Amy and Rachel at same time Sorry.\n",
      "Chandler By the way, that fight was totally arousing.\n",
      "Ross Dude. Well done. You know what? If I die, and Rachel dies and Monica dies then you can totally take care of Emma.\n",
      "Chandler Oh yeah? Well thanks.\n",
      "Ross So, so now do I get Joey?\n",
      "Chandler Okay, but you should know he eats five times a day and shoves pennies up his nose.\n",
      "Rachel Are you okay Mon?\n",
      "Monica uh huh.. I mean these things happen. Its' just a plate. Its not like somebody died.\n",
      "Phoebe It's all right. You can mourn.\n",
      "Monica starts crying Thank you. It was so beautiful. <gets up and walks towards the front door> I'm going to go to Joeys and get the pies.\n",
      "Joey Actually its not pies, its just pie.\n",
      "Monica I don't care. <pauses and realizes...> Oh my god. I've lost the will to scold.\n",
      "Rachel Look Amy, it got a little of control..Um.. and I'm sorry. You're my sister and uh.. if it really means that much to you..\n",
      "Amy So you're going to give me the baby?\n",
      "Rachel Uh. No.. I was going to let you use my Ralph Lauren discount.\n",
      "Amy starting to cry You are not going to regret this.\n",
      "Rachel She needs changing.\n",
      "Chandler Oh no no no.. I'll get her. I'm super-compentent and totally responsibile and fourth in line to raise Emma. I'll be right there Emma. Just let me get my trusty diaper bag here. <knocks over the box of china> Well.. what do you know? I guess, I'll be the one who dies first.\n",
      "Phoebe Hey, does Monica know about her broken plates yet?\n",
      "Chandler Nope...\n",
      "Phoebe Broke them all, huh?\n",
      "Chandler Yep...\n",
      "Phoebe You gonna tell her?\n",
      "Chandler Nope... (Monica walks in) Hey... so I'm gonna... put the plates back. You know, I think you were right, I don't think we should use these plates again for a looong time.\n",
      "Monica Like only if the queen comes?\n",
      "Chandler Maybe not even then. (Joey walks in)\n",
      "Joey Hey! I did it. I called my producer. I told him I had a family emergency, he totally bought it. Thanks for teaching me how to lie Pheebs.\n",
      "Phoebe No problem! Next week: stealing... (Chandler walks away to store the box of broken china.)\n",
      "Monica Bye plates!\n",
      "Joey Oh, you told her you broke all the plates, huh? (Chandler walks back, looking angrily at Joey)\n",
      "Monica What? Something happened with the plates?\n",

      "Monica Yeah with Chandler not getting paid, we could really use 300 million dollars.\n",
      "Chandler Yeah, because if I was at my old job we'd say 300 million? No thank you!\n",
      "Phoebe Hey will you get me tickets too?\n",

      "Monica You know what, Ross? I'm gonna throw in 50 bucks for you.\n",
      "Ross Why?\n",

      "Phoebe Get a room!\n",
      "Chandler Ok, so now that you're in, what are you gonna do if we win?\n",
      "Ross I don't know, probably just invest it.\n",
      "Chandler Ooh! Calm down ...\n",
      "Joey Seriously, that's your fantasy? To invest it?\n",
      "Ross Oh, I'm sorry, did I say \"invest it\"? I meant \"be cool and piss it all away\" (Joey and Chandler pleased)\n",

      "Rachel I don't really care about the Knicks.\n",

      "Rachel (touched) You would do that? I never get picked!\n",

      "Chandler You're right, it has been you dream for over 15 seconds.\n",
      "Ross (to Rachel) Uh, how long until they announce the numbers, Mommy?\n",
      "Chandler (looks around) I'll take this one too (to Ross) Uh ... Mommy?\n",
      "Ross Oh, I've gotten into the habit of calling Rachel \"Mommy\" when we're around Emma. Which I now realize we are not ...\n",
      "Rachel I'm hoping that if she hears it enough it will be her first word.\n",
      "Ross Although if we're gonna do that, we should probably call me \"Daddy\" too.\n",
      "Phoebe Oooh, I like that, \"daddy\" (in a sexy tone)\n",
      "Ross I ... I was just talking about Rachel.\n",
      "Phoebe (still in sexy tone) Oooh, is daddy getting angry? Is daddy gonna spank me?\n",
      "Ross (tries to be sexy too) Well that depends ... have you been a baaad gi .. (stops) no I can't.\n",
      "Chandler Hello? Hello? Oh, hey Charlie. Did anybody else hear? ... What? Susan got it?? How? Oh man, I would have slept with him!! .. Alright, bye. (hangs up)\n",
      "Joey Dude, I'm sorry. But hey, there's one spot left, right?\n",
      "Chandler Well no, Charlie's gonna get that.\n",
      "Monica Hey, don't say that! You got just as good a chance as anybody else of getting that job!\n",
      "Chandler He's the boss's son.\n",
      "Monica Come on, lottery!! (everybody cheers)\n",
      "Rachel Ooh, you guys, it starts in like 20 minutes.\n",
      "Monica Ok, here we go. We need to sort out the tickets as quickly as possible to see if we've won. So does anybody have any ideas how to organize this? (doesn't let them answer) Ok, how about this: we divide them into 6 groups of 40, and the remaining 10 can be read by whoever finishes their pile first.\n",
      "Rachel Ooh, I have another idea!\n",
      "Monica I'm sorry, idea time is over.\n",
      "Phoebe Ok, well, are all the tickets in the bowl?\n",
      "Monica Yeah.\n",
      "Chandler What about the ones you have on the nightstand?\n",
      "Monica There are no tickets on the nightstand!\n",
      "Chandler Yes there are, I just saw them a few minutes ago.\n",
      "Monica Un, no you didn't! You must be mistaken!\n",
      "Chandler Honey, there are like 20 tickets on the nightstand!\n",
      "Monica Chandler, sense the tone!!\n",
      "Rachel Well, well, well, look what mommy found!!\n",
      "Monica Ok, fine!! I bought 20 extra tickets for me and Chandler.\n",
      "Phoebe Uh! The psychic also said that I would be betrayed.\n",
      "Ross I can't believe this, I thought we were all in this together!\n",
      "Monica Hey, you just got in 5 minutes ago!\n",
      "Ross 3 minutes ago!!! I don't know why that's important ...\n",
      "Joey I was with you the whole time we were in Connecticut, when did you even get those?\n",
      "Monica When you were reading the dirty magazines without taking off the plastic!\n",
      "Joey (to Ross) I'll show you how.\n",
      "Rachel Ok, well Monica, suppose one of your \"special\" tickets win? How are you gonna feel when you win the lottery and you lose all your friends?\n",
      "Monica Please ... if I win the lottery, you guys are not gonna leave me. Someone gave me a basket of mini-muffins last week and I couldn't get rid of you for 3 days!\n",
      "Rachel Chandler, would you just tell her what she did was wrong?\n",
      "Chandler (to Mon) She's right, you shouldn't have bought tickets just for us ...\n",
      "Monica Ahhh! (shocked)\n",
      "Chandler Let me finish ... (to everyone else) however, it doesn't look like I'm gonna get this job so I can't afford to have principles, so screw you, the tickets are ours!! (takes tickets from Rachel)\n",
      "Monica There's the man I married!!\n",
      "Rachel All right, believe me.If you win the lottery, it's the last you're gonna hear from us!\n",
      "Monica Fine! Don't be my friends! I'll buy new friends! Yeah, and then I'll pay for their plastic surgery so they'd look just like you!\n",
      "Rachel (surprised) OH! Alright, you know what? That's it! I want my share of the tickets (picks up the bowl)!\n",
      "Joey Yeah, I want my tickets too (takes the bowl from Rachel)! And I'm buying the Knicks! And Steffi Graff, ah ah!\n",
      "Ross Than I want mine, too (takes the bowl from Joey)! And if I win I'm gonna put it all into a very low-yield bond.\n",
      "Phoebe Oh, you guys! We've got to keep all the tickets together (takes the bowl from Ross and puts it on the table)\n",
      "Monica No, no! We should divide them up (picks up the bowl) and I should get extra because we used my card to buy them!\n",
      "Joey Hey, if anybody gets extra tickets, it should be me! This all thing was my idea! (takes the bowl from Monica)\n",
      "Chandler Oh, yeah! Thanks for inventing the lottery!\n",
      "Rachel Ok, that's it! Just give'em to me! I'll split them up! (she tries to snatch the bowl from Joey's hands but she can't, so she pinches his nipple and she manages to take it)\n",
      "Joey (in pain) Oh!\n",
      "Phoebe (she takes the bowl from Rachel's hands and she starts running around the room and yelling) OOOOOHHHHH!\n",
      "Ross (trying to stop her) Hey, hey!!\n",
      "Phoebe (keeping on running and yelling) OOOOOHHHHH! (she stops) Fine, I can't take it anymore! I'm putting an end to this! (she goes out to the balcony)\n",
      "Rachel Oh, if she jumps, I get her tickets.\n",
      "Joey No, no! (they all go towards the balcony but they get jammed in the window)\n",
      "Phoebe If we are not doing it together, we're not doing it at all! So, say goodbye to your tickets! (She holds out the bowl, and makes as to drop the tickets on the street).\n",
      "Everyone NO!!\n",
      "Phoebe Don't come any closer!\n",
      "Chandler Can I come a little bit closer, valuable things are getting squished...\n",
      "Phoebe No, what's more important, your friends or money?\n",
      "Everyone but Monica Friends!\n",
      "Monica Money! (they all look at her) Friends...\n",
      "Phoebe Hey Monica, what about your extra tickets?\n",
      "Monica They're all in there! Even these five that I hid in my bra (takes some tickets out of her bra and gives them to Phoebe)...\n",
      "Ross Monica!\n",
      "Phoebe Ok, good! (pause) You guys were so scared! There was no way I was gonna dump this...(a pigeon swoops down, scaring Phoebe who drops the bowl on the street) Oh God, no! (pause) I think I broke your bowl.\n",
      "Ross Go, go, go!!\n",
      "Phoebe What a beautiful night to be running around the street, looking for tickets. And the wind sure made it fun.\n",
      "Monica Phoebe, we lost half of them.\n",
      "Phoebe So, what? Monica, we have the winning ticket! My psychic said I was gonna win, remember?\n",
      "Ross Weird.. your psychic didn't mention anything about the scary pigeon...\n",
      "Phoebe As a matter of fact she said that's how I am going to die. (pause ) So, excuse me for being a little skittish.\n",
      "Chandler (looking at the answering machine) Hey, there's two messages. These could be from work!\n",
      "Monica Oh, play them!\n",
      "Chandler Ok, here we go! (he pushes the play button)\n",
      "Message (Phoebe's voice) \"Hello. Th-this is the pigeon from the balcony calling to apologise\" (they all turns to look at Phoebe) \"I sh.. I shouldn't have knocked the tickets out of the pretty lady's hand. It-it was all my fault. Not hers. Bye. Coo.\"\n",
      "Phoebe Well, I bet that was very hard for him to do.\n",
      "Second message \"Hey Chandler, it's Charlie\"\n",
      "Chandler This is..shhh!\n",
      "Second Message \"Listen, oh... it turns I got the last spot. I'm really sorry man, it was a lot of fun working with you. Give me a call if you want.\"\n",

      "Chandler Yeah, you know, I really thought I deserved it. (pause) But... let's go win the lottery... I mean, we still have 130 chances to win, right?\n",
      "Monica (she draws out a ticket from a pocket of her pants) 131! (they kiss)\n",
      "Ross (on the phone) Goodnight sweetheart! I love you. And remember, you're daddy's little girl... (covering the phone, to Rachel) Phoebe's totally ruined that for me... (he passes the receiver to Rachel)\n",

      "Rachel I don't know all the words.\n",
      "Ross I'm just, I'm just glad I didn't miss my daughter's first words (goes back to checking the tickets).\n",

      "Ross Ok, use it in a sentence.\n",
      "Rachel Ok... \"Emma just said gleba\"!\n",
      "Ross It's not a word!\n",
      "Rachel Okay, okay, okay, fine, I'm gonna look it up (she goes and picks up the dictionary).\n",
      "Ross Oh, oh, ok, great. You know what, while you're at it she said another word the other day, why don't you, why don't you look up: pbbqqt....\n",
      "Rachel (searching the dictionary) Alright, okay, okay, gleba, gleba... (excited) Gleba! Ha! Here it is: the fleshy, spore-bearing inner mass of a certain fungi.\n",
      "Ross She's gonna be a scientist! (kisses Rachel on the head, very moved)\n",

      "Monica (answering phone) Hello? Hold on. It's your boss.\n",
      "Chandler Ah, the \"I'm sorry I rejected you\" phone call. I'm not used to getting it from guys. (on the phone, getting up from the sofa) Hey, Steve.\n",
      "Steve Chandler, hi! I'm sure you've heard we filled the three positions. We just felt that with your maturity and experience, you wouldn't be happy being someone's assistant.\n",
      "Chandler Oh no no no no, I'd love to be somebody's assistant! Answering phones, getting coffee, I live for that stuff! And I'm not too mature... farts, boobies, butt cracks!\n",
      "Steve Chandler, you were the strongest person in the program. We're offering you the position of junior copywriter.\n",
      "Chandler Me, that guy who just said butt cracks?\n",
      "Steve Yes, that's right. We're excited about the level of sophistication you'll be bringing to the job.\n",
      "Chandler Ok well, thanks, you won't regret it. I'll see you tomorrow (hangs up).\n",
      "Chandler What? (pause) Oh, yeah, I'm gonna be a junior copywriter.\n",
      "Everybody (excited) Oh my God, congratulations!\n",
      "Monica Oh sweetie, I'm so proud of you!\n",
      "Chandler Does that mean I get the good loving tonight?\n",
      "Monica You bet! No TV or anything! (she gets up from the sofa and goes to the kitchen area)\n",
      "Joey (to Chandler) Hey, that is so great about the job.\n",
      "Chandler Thanks, man.\n",
      "Joey And I like to think I had a little something to do with it.\n",
      "Chandler Really? What?\n",
      "Joey Well, before, with the wishbone... I didn't wish we would win the lottery, I wished you'd get the job.\n",
      "Chandler (smiling, surprised) Oh yeah? (looks towards the kitchen, worried) Listen, don't tell Monica, she'll rip your heart right out.\n",
      "Joey Oh yeah.\n",
      "Rachel You know what? There is a little part of me that really thought we were gonna win.\n",
      "Ross Me too. So much for my dinosaur/Amelia Earhart theme park.\n",
      "Phoebe You guys, what was the Powerball number again?\n",
      "Monica and Ross Seven.\n",
      "Phoebe We won.\n",
      "Rachel What?\n",
      "Phoebe We won!\n",
      "Monica Let me see!\n",
      "Phoebe Don't tear it.\n",
      "Ross Phoebe, you don't have any of the first five numbers.\n",
      "Phoebe I know that, but look, we've got the Powerball number, we've won 3 dollars!\n",
      "Chandler Wow, you'd think we should get that over 20 years or go for the big payout.\n",
      "Phoebe (still very excited) I don't care, I've never won anything before, I can't believe this!\n",
      "Rachel So Pheebs, what are you going to do with your $3?\n",
      "Phoebe It's not all mine. We all get 50 cents.\n",
      "Monica You know what? You can have mine.\n",
      "Chandler Me too.\n",
      "Joey Me too.\n",
      "Rachel Me too.\n",
      "Ross I guess if everybody else is...\n",
      "Joey (sitting in a chair) Hey guys, so I just called the Powerball hotline, can you believe it? Nobody won.\n",
      "Phoebe I beg to differ (shows him her cup of coffee and her plate of cookies).\n",
      "Gunther Maybe nobody won the jackpot, but there was this guy in here earlier, and he found the ticket on the street, right outside, and won $10,000 (goes to the counter).\n",
      "Phoebe (hides her mouth behind the cup and speaks in the \"pigeon voice\" from before) Coo, again. Don't blame the pretty lady. It was not her fault. It was me, the pigeon, coo! (pause) Seriously, stop staring at her.\n",

      "Joey Either eat it, or be in it.\n",
      "Monica Spoon? (Hands him one and he tastes it.) So, what do you think?\n",
      "The Food Critic I’m torn, between my integrity and my desire to avoid a beating. But I must be honest, your soap is abysmal. (Throws down the spoon and walks out.)\n",
      "Joey Thata girl! Huh? We should get out of here; there’s a new class comin’ in.\n",
      "The Cooking Teacher Welcome to introduction to cooking. Now, before we start, can anyone tell me the difference between a hollandaise sauce and a bearnaise sauce? (No one can.)\n",
      "Monica I can.\n",
      "The Cooking Teacher Okay, go ahead.\n",
      "Monica Well umm, they both have a egg yolk and butter base, but a bearnaise has shallots, shirvel, and most importantly tarragon.\n",
      "The Cooking Teacher That’s very good, what’s your name?\n",
      "Monica Monica.\n",

      "Ross My son? Pretty serious. (There’s a knock on the door and Ross answers it.) Oh hey Katie! (The cashier from before) What uh, what are you doing here?\n",
      "Katie Well, the delivery went out to you and I realized they forgot this. (A blanket.)\n",
      "Ross Ah, must’ve been fairly obvious since it was the only thing left in your store.\n",
      "Katie Listen, to be honest, home deliveries are really a part of my job description.\n",
      "Ross Oh. (Reaches into his pocket for some money as Rachel enters the living room and watches holding two stuffed dinosaurs.)\n",
      "Katie Oh uh…I actually came here to ask you out.\n",
      "Ross Oh! Wow! Uh, yeah! That sounds great. I’m just gonna put this (The money) back in my pocket, pretend that didn’t happen. Uh yeah, actually I’m free now. Do you wanna grab some coffee or…\n",
      "Katie Sure!\n",
      "Rachel Horny bitch. (They both look at her, pretending that the dinosaurs she’s holding are arguing.) No! You’re a horny bitch! Noooo! You’re the horny bitch! No! You’re a horny bitch!\n",
      "Rachel So you guys go, have a really good time.\n",
      "Ross (To Katie) Yeah, I’m just gonna grab my coat. And uh, and my whip. (Katie looks worried.) Y’know because of the Indiana Jones? (Katie laughs) Not-not because I’m-I’m into S&M. (Katie’s worried again.) I’m not-I’m not into anything weird. Y’know? Just-just normal sex. (Katie is uncomfortable.) So, I’m gonna grab my coat. (Does so, leaving Katie and Rachel alone.)\n",
      "Rachel So, you had a good day huh? Big commission; picked up a daddy.\n",

      "Chandler I can’t even believe this! I really come off that badly?\n",
      "Phoebe Oh! It’s okay, you calm down after a while and then people can see how really sweet and wonderful you really are.\n",
      "Chandler Oh good. Good, because I’m sure this interview is gonna last a couple of weeks.\n",
      "Phoebe All right, don’t freak out! Okay? I-I will help you. How long before you have to leave?\n",
      "Chandler An hour.\n",
      "Phoebe I can’t help you.\n",
      "Chandler Phoebe!\n",
      "Phoebe All right, all right, we’ll just do our best. Okay? So let’s say I’m the interviewer and I’m meeting you for the first time. Okay. \"Hi! Come on in, I’m uh, Regina Philange.\"\n",

      "Joey Cheese makes me thirsty.\n",

      "Joey All right.\n",
      "The Cooking Teacher (To Monica) Oh! Something smells good over at Monica’s station! (She tries Monica’s fettuccini.) Oh my God! This is absolutely amazing! You’ve never made this before?\n",
      "Monica Oh no! I don’t know anything about cooking. I had to ask someone what it’s called when the, when the water makes those little bubbles.\n",
      "The Cooking Teacher Well, hats off to the chef.\n",
      "Monica I-I-I’m sorry, your-your mouth was full, I didn’t hear what you said. Umm, hats off to who now?\n",
      "The Cooking Teacher The chef!\n",
      "Monica That’s right.\n",
      "Chandler …I think you’ll find if I come to work here, I don’t micro-manage. I don’t shy away from delegating.\n",
      "Phoebe Um-hmm, that’s good to know. But let’s stop focusing on what you don’t do, and start focusing on what you do do.\n",
      "Chandler (suppressing a smile) What I do do…is manage to uh, create an atmosphere of support for the people working with me.\n",
      "Phoebe I see. Nice sidestep on the do do thing by the way.\n",
      "Chandler Hardest thing I’ve ever done in my life.\n",
      "Phoebe You gotta go!\n",
      "Chandler Oh! (Stands up.)\n",
      "Phoebe Okay, don’t worry. You’re ready.\n",
      "Chandler Really?\n",
      "Phoebe Absolutely! Just fight all your natural instincts and you’ll be great.\n",
      "Chandler Okay.\n",
      "The Cooking Teacher Ah Monica, my star student.\n",
      "Monica Y’know, you called me that before so I-I took the liberty of fashioning a star out of aluminum foil. Now, no pressure, you like my cookies, you give me the star. (Hands it to her.)\n",
      "The Cooking Teacher (tasting the cookie and with her mouthful) Oh, yum-yum-yum. (Hands the star back.)\n",
      "Monica Wow! A star! (The class glares at her.) I know you all hate me and-and I’m sorry, but I don’t care.\n",
      "The Cooking Teacher Okay Joey, you’re up next. (Tries one of his cookies.) This are good! This is amazing! You get an A!\n",
      "Joey I can an A? In-in school? (To Joey) Hey, I’m a dork.\n",
      "Monica Joey! I’m so proud of you!\n",
      "The Cooking Teacher I think you should give him your star.\n",
      "Monica Excuse me? He doesn’t even know what he’s doing!\n",
      "The Cooking Teacher We’re all beginners here. Nobody knows what they’re doing.\n",
      "Monica I do! I’m a professional chef! (The class gasps.) Oh relax! It’s not a courtroom drama!\n",
      "The Cooking Teacher If you’re a professional chef, what are you doing taking Introduction to Cooking?\n",
      "Joey Yeah!\n",
      "Monica I’m-I’m sorry, it’s just that umm… Well I-I cook at this restaurant, Alessandro’s, and umm I just got a really bad review…\n",
      "The Cooking Teacher Oh Alessandro’s! I love that place!\n",
      "Monica You do?\n",
      "The Cooking Teacher Oh yes! You’re an excellent chef! As a person you’re a little…\n",
      "Monica Oh, I’m totally crazy, but you-you like the food?\n",
      "The Cooking Teacher Very much.\n",
      "Monica Okay then, I don’t stink. I’m a good chef. Okay. (Starts to leave.)\n",
      "Joey Whoa-whoa-whoa-whoa! I don’t want to go. I’m having fun.\n",
      "The Cooking Teacher Well actually, did either of you pay for this class?\n",
      "Joey Hey-hey-hey, if my friend says it’s time to go, it’s time to go. (Starts to leave, but comes back for his cookies.)\n",
      "Chandler …also I was the point person on my company’s transition from the KL-5 to GR-6 system.\n",

      "Chandler That I did. That I did.\n",
      "The Interviewer So let’s talk a little bit about your duties.\n",
      "Chandler (nervous) My duties? (Trying not to crack a joke) All right.\n",
      "The Interviewer Now you’ll be heading a whole division, so you’ll have a lot of duties.\n",
      "Chandler (trying not to laugh) I see.\n",
      "The Interviewer But there’ll be perhaps 30 people under you so you can dump a certain amount on them.\n",
      "Chandler (really try not to laugh) Good to know.\n",
      "The Interviewer We can go into detail…\n",
      "Chandler No don’t I beg of you!\n",
      "The Interviewer All right then, we’ll have a definite answer for you on Monday, but I think I can say with some confidence, you’ll fit in well here.\n",
      "Chandler (relieved) Really?!\n",
      "The Interviewer Absolutely. (They walk to the door.) You can relax; you did great.\n",
      "Chandler Yeah I gotta say thank you, I was really nervous. Y’know I’ve been told I come on to strong, make to many jokes, and then it was really hard to sidestep that duty thing. (The interviewer doesn’t understand) Duties. (Still doesn’t.) Duties! (Still doesn’t.) Poo. (Still doesn’t.)\n",
      "The Interviewer Poo?\n",
      "Chandler Oh my God this doesn’t count! Okay? The interview was over, that was the real Chandler Bing in there, this is just some crazy guy out in the hall! Call security! There’s a crazy guy out in the hall!\n",
      "The Interviewer Poo?!\n",
      "Chandler I’ll look forward to your call. (Walks away.)\n",
      "Ross Hey.\n",
      "Rachel Hi! You’re back from your date!\n",
      "Ross How are you?\n",
      "Rachel I’m fine, but that’s not important. What’s important is how was she?\n",
      "Ross Uhh, it was fun. We, we just had coffee.\n",
      "Rachel Oh uh-huh, uh-huh, coffee, a little rub-rub-rub under the table.\n",
      "Ross What’s uh, what’s going on? Do you not, do you not like Katie?\n",
      "Rachel No! No, she’s—She was nice. I mean, she’s a little slutty, but who isn’t?\n",
      "Ross I liked her.\n",
      "Rachel Of course you did Ross, you would date a gorilla if it called you Indiana Jones!\n",
      "Ross Did you get like a fresh batch of pregnancy hormones today?!\n",
      "Rachel No! It’s just that, Kate bothered me.\n",
      "Ross Why? What was wrong with her?\n",

I know it’s a terrible thing to even think this, and it’s completely inappropriate, but I want you to be at my constant beck and call 24 hours a day!

      "Joey Y'know what, hold on, let me go get Chandler. (gets up and leaves.)\n",
      "Ross (surprised) Hi!\n",
      "Rachel and Bonnie Hi!\n",
      "Bonnie Rachel was just helping me out. My head got all sunburned.\n",
      "Ross Awww.\n",
      "Bonnie (to Rachel) Thanks a million.\n",
      "Rachel Oh, you’re welcome a million.\n",
      "Bonnie (getting up and leaving) (to Ross) Okay, I’ll see you in our room.\n",
      "Ross Yeah. (closes the door, and goes over and kisses Rachel.)\n",
      "Rachel (softly) Oh my God.\n",
      "Ross I know.\n",
      "Ross (stopping suddenly and getting up) Okay, I gotta go.\n",
      "Rachel Whoa! What?! Why?!\n",
      "Ross Well, I-I gotta go break up with Bonnie.\n",
      "Rachel Here?! Now?!\n",
      "Ross Well, yeah. I can’t-I can’t stay here all night, and if I go in there she’s-she’s gonna wanna... do stuff.\n",
      "Rachel Well, can’t you tell her that you are not in the mood?\n",
      "Ross No, she likes that. Yeah. Faking sleep doesn’t work either, I can’t tell you how many mornings I woke up with her...\n",
      "Rachel (interrupting) Whoa-ho.\n",
      "Ross Whoa-oh, okay! Yeah, why am I telling you that?\n",
      "Rachel I don’t know.\n",
      "Ross Yeah, yeah. (opens the door) It wasn’t every morning.\n",
      "Rachel Oh, making it worse!\n",
      "Ross Okay.\n",
      "Phoebe Sr. So I guess you’d like to know how it all happened.\n",
      "Phoebe I-I mean I, well I think I can figure it out. I guess y'know I was born, and everyone started lying their asses off!\n",
      "Phoebe Sr. Noo! No! It wasn’t like that I... Remember how I told you how Lily, Frank, and I we were, we were close. Well, we were, we were very close.\n",
      "Phoebe How close?\n",
      "Phoebe Sr. Well, the-the three of us we were, kind of umm, a couple.\n",
      "Phoebe I don’t even know how that would work!\n",
      "Phoebe Sr. Well, we were...\n",
      "Phoebe (interrupting) I’m not asking!\n",
      "Phoebe Sr. Well, any how, some how I got pregnant, and, and I was scared. I was stupid and sellfish, and I was 18 years old. I mean, you remember what it’s like to be eighteen years old?\n",
      "Phoebe Yeah. Let’s see, my had Mom killed herself, and my Dad had run off, and I was living in a Gremlin with a guy named Cindy who talked to his hand.\n",
      "Phoebe Sr. Well, I’m so sorry. I thought I was leaving you with the best parents in the world, I didn’t even hear about your Mom and Dad til a couple of years ago, and by then you were already grown up. I don’t know, you’re here, and I would, I would really, I would like to get to know you.\n",
      "Phoebe Yeah, well, everybody does! I’m a really cool person. And y'know you had 29 years to find that out, but you didn’t even try! Y'know what, you walked out on me, and I’m just, I’m gonna do the same thing to you.\n",
      "Phoebe Sr. Wait!\n",
      "Phoebe I don’t ever want to see you again!\n",
      "Phoebe (walking back in with her hand over her eyes.) Umm, where’s my purse?\n",
      "Monica (closing the fridge in disgust) Shoot! We’re out of soda.\n",
      "Chandler (jumping up) Oh, I’ll go out and get you some.\n",
      "Monica Really?!\n",
      "Chandler Nope! Because I’m not your boyfriend. (to Phoebe, who’s entering) Hey Pheebs, how did it go?\n",
      "Phoebe Well, umm, my Mom’s friend, Phoebe, is actually my birth Mom.\n",
      "Chandler I found a dried up seashores.\n",
      "Monica Sweety, what are you talking about?\n",
      "Phoebe Oh, my new Mom, who-who’s a big, fat abandoner! (starts to go upstairs)\n",
      "Joey Whoa, wait, Pheebs, wait a second! Don’t you wanna stay here and talk about it?\n",
      "Phoebe No. I’m just, I wanna, I need to be alone.\n",
      "Phoebe (turning around, insistently) Monica!\n",
      "Monica Oh.\n",
      "Ross It’s over.\n",
      "Rachel Oh, was it awful?\n",
      "Ross Well, it was loong. I didn’t even realise how late it was, until I noticed the 5 o’clock shadow on her head. (They both start to laugh, then stop themselves quickly.) Anyway, she didn’t want to stay. I called a cab; she just left.\n",
      "Rachel I wrote you a letter.\n",
      "Ross Ohh! Thank you! I like mail. (He goes to kiss her again, but she turns away.)\n",
      "Rachel (handing him the letter) It’s just some things I’ve been thinking about. Some things about us, and before we can even think about the two of us getting back together, I just need to know how you feel about this stuff.\n",
      "Ross Okay. (He leans in to kiss her again, but she leans back preventing him from making contact.) Wow, it’s-it’s 5:30 in the morning. (Rachel laughs) So, I’d better get cracking on this baby.\n",
      "Rachel Well, I’ll be waiting for you, just come up when you’re done.\n",
      "Ross Okay, I’ll be up in, (looks at the letter) 18 pages. Front and back. Very exciting.\n",
      "Ross Oh. (looks at his watch) Oh-oh. (takes a drink of coffee and resumes reading the letter)\n",
      "Rachel (coming down the stairs) Hey! (Ross jumps up, and quickly puts the letter back together, pretending like he has just finished it.) What happened to you? Why didn’t you come up?\n",
      "Ross Done!\n",
      "Rachel You just finished?\n",
      "Ross Well, I wanted to be thorough. I mean this-this is clearly very, very important to you, to us! And so I wanted to read every word carefully, twice!\n",
      "Rachel So umm, does it?\n",
      "Ross I’m sorry.\n",
      "Rachel Does it?\n",
      "Ross Does it? Does it? Yeah, I wanted to give that whole ‘Does it?’ part just another glance.\n",
      "Rachel What are you talking about, Ross, you just said that you read it twice! Look, y'know what, either it does or it doesn’t, and if you have to even think about it...\n",
      "Ross (interrupting) No, Rach, no. I don’t, I don’t, I don’t have to think about it, in fact, I’ve decided, I’ve decided that, that it.......does.\n",
      "Rachel Are you sure?\n",
      "Ross Oh, sure! I’m sure.\n",
      "Rachel I know. (Hugs him more violently this time and pushes him back away from the letter.)\n",
      "Chandler All right, there’s a nuclear holocaust, I’m the last man on Earth. Would you go out with me?\n",
      "Monica Ennnh.\n",
      "Chandler I’ve got canned goods.\n",
      "Joey (jumping up in a hole that he is digging, he is shoulder deep) Hey, you guys! Take a look at this! (Chandler and Monica jump up and go over to the hole.) Check this baby out, dug me a hole!\n",
      "Chandler Excellent hole, Joe.\n",
      "Joey Oh no! No!! My hole!!\n",
      "Monica (screaming in pain) Ow!! Ow!!!\n",
      "Joey (climbing out of the hole) What?! What?!! What is it?!\n",
      "Monica Jellyfish sting! Oh, it hurts! It hurts!! It hurts!!\n",
      "Chandler Well, can we help?! You want us to take you back to the house?!\n",
      "Monica It’s like two miles!\n",
      "Joey Yeah, and I’m a little tired from digging the hole.\n",
      "Monica Oh damn the jellyfish. Damn all the jellyfish!\n",
      "Chandler We’ve got to do something!\n",
      "Joey Well, there’s really only one thing you can do.\n",
      "Monica What?! What is it?!\n",
      "Joey You’re gonna have to pee on it.\n",
      "Monica What?!! Gross!!\n",
      "Joey Don’t blame me, I saw it on The Discovery Channel.\n",
      "Chandler Y'know what, he’s right. There’s something like uh, ammonia in that, that like kills the pain.\n",
      "Monica Well forget it! It doesn’t hurt that (tries to take a step) baaad!!!!\n",
      "Joey If you want some privacy you can use my hole.\n",
      "Phoebe Well, I’m ready to get the hell out of here! (Sees Ross and Rachel cuddling on the couch.) Oh. Are you? Are you?!! (they nod ‘Yes.’) Ohh! That’s so great!! Ooh, not for Bonnie. (they nod ‘No.’) But for you, yay! Ohh.\n",
      "Ross Hey!\n",
      "Rachel How was the beach?\n",
      "Monica Nothing, I don’t know.\n",
      "Ross What happened?\n",
      "Monica Nothing. I’m gonna take a shower.\n",
      "Chandler Me too!!\n",
      "Joey Me too.\n",
      "Phoebe Okay, I’m gonna put this (her suitcase) in the car.\n",
      "Rachel Ooh, I have to go pack. (Gets up to do so.) It really does?\n",
      "Ross It does. It really and truly does.\n",
      "Ross (finding the part) (looks up in disgust) It so does not!!!\n",
      "Ross She wants me to take responsibility for everything that went wrong in our relationship. I mean she goes on for five pages about, about how I was unfaithful to her! (Both Joey and Chandler shrug their shoulders as to say ”Well...”) (yelling) WE WERE ON A BREAK!!!!!\n",
      "Chandler Oh my God! If you say that one more time, I’m gonna break up with you!\n",
      "Ross Fine! Fine! But this break-up was not all my fault, and she, she says here, (reading from the letter) “If you accept full responsibility...” (to Chandler and Joey) Full responsibility! “...I can begin to trust you again. Does that seem like something you can do. (yells at Joey) Does it?!!”\n",
      "Joey No?\n",
      "Chandler Look, Ross, you have what you want, you’re back with Rachel. If you bring this up now you’re gonna wreck the best thing that even happened to you.\n",
      "Ross (calming down) Yeah, I know. I mean, no, you’re right. Yeah I guess I’ll let it go. But you-you understand how-how hard it is to forget about this.\n",
      "Joey Sure, it’s hard to forget! But that doesn’t mean you have to talk about it! A lot of things happened on that trip that we should never, (to Chandler) ever talk about.\n",
      "Ross What the hell happened on that beach?!\n",
      "Joey It’s between us and the sea, Ross!\n",
      "Phoebe (to the person that answered the door) Hi, Ursula.\n",
      "Ursula Hey!\n",
      "Phoebe Okay, well umm, I know that we haven’t talked in a long time, but umm okay, our Mom is not our birth Mom. This-this other lady is our birth Mom.\n",
      "Ursula Right, okay, the one that lives in Montuak, umm-hmm.\n",
      "Phoebe (shocked) You know her?!\n",
      "Ursula No, I umm, I read about her in Mom’s suicide note.\n",
      "Phoebe There-there was a suicide note?! (Ursula nods ‘Yes.’) Well, do you still have it?\n",
      "Ursula (disgusted) Hang on. (She goes into her apartment and slams the door in Phoebe’s face.)\n",
      "Phoebe I can’t believe you didn’t tell me there was a suicide note!\n",
      "Ursula Yeah. So how have you been doing?\n",
      "Phoebe I, umm, shut up!\n",
      "Phoebe (reading from the note) “Good-bye Phoebe and Ursula. I’ll miss you. P.S. Your Mom lives in Montauk.” You just wrote this!\n",
      "Ursula Well, it’s pretty much the gist. Well, except for the poem. You read the poem, right?\n",
      "Phoebe Noooo!!\n",
      "Ursula All right, hang on! (She takes the note, goes back into her apartment and slams the door shut.)\n",
      "Monica Pass the cheese, please.\n",
      "Monica My God, you can’t even look at me! Can you?\n",
      "Joey Nope.\n",
      "Chandler (jumping up) Hey! Phoebe! We can talk to Phoebe!!\n",
      "Phoebe No. I’m-I’m to depressed to talk.\n",
      "Chandler I’ll give you a thousand dollars to talk to us.\n",
      "Ross (coming back in with Rachel) Hey, you guys! What do you, what do you think about making that beach trip an annual thing?\n",
      "Chandler, Monica, and Joey NO!!!\n",
      "Rachel All right, that’s it, you guys! What happened out there?\n",
      "Monica What? We took a walk, nothing happened. I can back with nothing all over me.\n",
      "Ross and Rachel Come on!\n",
      "Ross What happened? Joey?\n",
      "Joey All right. (gets up)\n",
      "Monica (stopping him) No! Joey, we swore we’d never tell!\n",
      "Chandler (running over and joining Monica) They’ll never understand!\n",
      "Joey Well, we have to say something! We have to get it out! It’s eating me alive!! Monica got stung by a jellyfish.\n",
      "Monica (interrupting) All right!! All right. (walks slowly into the living room) I got stung. Stung bad. I couldn’t stand. I-I couldn’t walk.\n",
      "Chandler (following Monica) We were two miles from the house. Scared and alone. We didn’t think we could make it. (He goes to put his hands on Monica’s shoulders but for some reason can quite complete the action and pulls back.)\n",
      "Monica I was in too much pain.\n",
      "Joey And I was tired from digging the huge hole!\n",
      "Chandler And then Joey remembered something.\n",
      "Joey I’d seen this thing on The Discovery Channel...\n",
      "Ross Wait a minute! I saw that! On The Discovery Channel, yeah! About jellyfish and how if you... (stops suddenly and turns to look at Monica) Ewwww!! You peed on yourself?!\n",
      "Phoebe and Rachel Ewwww!!\n",
      "Monica You can’t say that!! You-you don’t know!! I mean I thought I was gonna pass out from the pain! Anyway I-I tried, but I-I couldn’t...bend that way. So... (looks at Joey.)\n",
      "Phoebe, Ross, and Rachel (turning to look at Joey) Ewwww!!\n",
      "Joey That’s right I stepped up! She’s my friend and she needed help! And if I had too, I’d pee on anyone of you! Only, uhh, I couldn’t. I got the stage fright. I wanted to help, but there was too much pressure. So-so I uh, I turned to Chandler.\n",
      "Chandler (wails loudly into his hands) Joey kept screaming at me, “Do it now! Do it!! Do it! Do it now!!” Sometimes late at night I can still here the screaming.\n",
      "Joey (laughs) That’s ‘cause sometimes I just do it through my wall to freak you out.\n",
      "Phoebe (singing) “...fuchsia and mauvvve. Those are the 66 colours of my bedroommmm.” (applause) Thank you, thank you. Ohh, and I invite you to count the colours in your bedroom. (Sees that Phoebe Sr. has entered, and to her) Except for you. You go away.\n",
      "Phoebe Sr. I’ll go in a second, I-I just wanted to tell you that there hasn’t been a day where I didn’t regret giving you up.\n",
      "Phoebe Okay, bye.\n",
      "Phoebe Sr. No, I’m not done. I-I-I just want you to know that I, the reason I didn’t look you up was, well I was afraid that you’d react, just well like, the way, the way you’re reacting right now, and can’t we just, y'know, start from here?\n",
      "Phoebe No.\n",
      "Phoebe Sr. Sorry. But just one last thing. Y'know you came looking for family. I’m family, I’m it. Now, now I’m done. (starts to leave)\n",
      "Phoebe But, it’s not like we’re losing anything. Y'know?\n",
      "Phoebe Sr. Yeah, I guess you’re right.\n",
      "Phoebe It’s not like we-we know each other or anything. Or that have anything in common.\n",
      "Phoebe Sr. Well, I don’t know. I mean it’s not like we don’t have anything in common. I mean I like uh, pizza.\n",
      "Phoebe I-I like pizza!\n",
      "Phoebe Sr. You do?! Wait, I like umm, the Beetles.\n",
      "Phoebe Oh my God, so do I!\n",
      "Phoebe Sr. I knew it, wow!!\n",
      "Phoebe Wait-wait-wait, wait! Puppies. Cute or ugly?\n",
      "Phoebe Sr. Ohh, so cute.\n",
      "Phoebe Uh-huh, well! But umm, still I’m-I’m mad at you.\n",
      "Phoebe Sr. I know. I’m mad at me too.\n",
      "Phoebe Well umm, do you wanna get something to eat? I’m kinda hungry.\n",
      "Phoebe Sr. Hey! Me too!\n",
      "Phoebe All right, stop it. Now you’re just doing it to freak me out.\n",
      "Rachel Oh-hooo, I missed you.\n",
      "Ross I missed you too.\n",
      "Rachel Ooh, I was soo nervous about that letter. But the way you owned up to everything, it just showed me how much you’ve grown. Y'know?\n",
      "Ross (getting miffed) I suppose.\n",
      "Rachel You have! Ross, you should give yourself credit. I mean my Mom never thought this would work out. It was all, “Once a cheater, always a cheater.”\n",
      "Ross (getting angry) Umm-hmm.\n",
      "Rachel Ooh, I just wish we hadn’t lost those four months, but if time was what you needed just to gain a little perspective...\n",
      "Ross (yelling from the bedroom) WE WERE ON A BREAK!!!!!!!\n",
      "Chandler (entering with Joey) (to Monica) Coffee house?\n",
      "Monica You bet.\n",
      "Ross And for the record, it took two people to break up this relationship!!\n",
      "Rachel Yeah! You and that girl from that copy place, which yesterday you took full responsibility for!!\n",
      "Ross I didn’t know what I was taking full responsibility for! Okay?! I didn’t finish the whole letter!\n",
      "Rachel What?!!\n",
      "Ross I fell asleep!\n",
      "Rachel You fell asleep?!\n",
      "Ross It was 5:30 in the morning, and you had rambled on for 18 pages. Front and back!! (they go into the living room, trapping Monica, Chandler, and Joey in the kitchen) (to Rachel) Oh-oh-oh, and by the way, Y-O-U-apostrophe-R-E means ‘you are,’ Y-O-U-R means ‘your!’\n",
      "Rachel Y'know I can’t believe I even thought about getting back together again! We are so over!!\n",
      "Ross (starts to cry) FINE BY ME!! (he opens the door and traps Chandler behind it)\n",
      "Rachel Oh, oh, and hey-hey-hey, those little spelling tips will come in handy when you’re at home on Saturday nights playing Scrabble with Monica!!\n",
      "Monica Hey!!\n",
      "Rachel (to Monica) Sorry!! (to Ross) I just feel bad about all that sleep you’re gonna miss wishing you were with me!\n",
      "Ross Oh, no-no-no don’t you worry about me falling asleep. I still have your letter!!!\n",
      "Rachel And hey! Just so you know, it’s not that common! It doesn’t happen to every guy! And it is a big deal!!\n",
      "Chandler I KNEW IT!!!!\n",
      "Monica (sets down some cards) Gin.\n",
      "Chandler We were playing Gin? Y'know if we were a couple, we could play this game naked.\n",
      "Monica Will you stop!\n",
      "Chandler Okay. All right.\n",
      "Monica Okay, all right, I think you’re great, I think you’re sweet, and you’re smart, and I love you. But you will always be the guy who peed on me.\n",

      "Bonnie All right, I was 15, it was my best friend, Ruth, and we got drunk on that hard cider, and then suddenly, I don’t know, we were, we were making out.\n",
      "Chandler Tell it again. (pause, we see Rachel is not amused.) Seriously.\n",
      "Rachel (to Monica) I mean is that woman capable of talking about anything else but sex?\n",
      "Joey Yeah, sure. Well y'know, earlier she was talking about geography.\n",

      "Joey That you’re actually 50?\n",
      "Phoebe No-no, that’s not, that’s not me Phoebe, that’s her pal Phoebe. According to her high school yearbook, they were like B.F.F. (Ross and Bonnie look at her quizzically) Best Friends Forever.\n",
      "All Oh!\n",
      "Rachel That is so cool.\n",
      "Phoebe I know! So this woman probably could like have all kinds of stories about my parents, and she might even know like where my Dad is. So I looked her up, and she lives out by the beach. So maybe this weekend we could go to the beach?\n",
      "All Yeah! Yeah, we can!\n",

      "Monica Ross! He's playing with my spatulas again!\n",
      "Ross Okay, look, he's not gonna hurt them, right?\n",
      "Monica Do you always have to bring him here?\n",
      "Ross I didn't wanna leave him alone. Alright? We- we had our first fight this morning. I think it has to do with my working late. I said some things that I didn't mean, and he- he threw some faeces...\n",
      "Chandler Y'know, if you're gonna work late, I could look in on him for you.\n",
      "Ross Oh, that'd be great! Okay, but if you do, make sure it seems like you're there to see him, okay, and you're not like doing it as a favour to me.\n",
      "Chandler Okay, but if he asks, I'm not going to lie.\n",
      "David ...But, you can't actually test this theory, because today's particle accelerators are nowhere near powerful enough to simulate these conditions.\n",
      "Phoebe Okay, alright, I have a question, then.\n",
      "David Yuh.\n",
      "Phoebe Um, were you planning on kissing me ever?\n",
      "David Uh, that's definitely a, uh, valid question. And, uh, the answer would be (Writes YES on the board) yes. Yes I was. But, see, I wanted it to be this phenomenal kiss that happened at this phenomenal moment, because, well, 'cause it's you.\n",
      "Phoebe Sure.\n",
      "David Right. But, see, the longer I waited, the more phenomenal the kiss had to be, and now we've reached a place where it's just gotta be one of those things where I just like... sweep everything off the table and throw you down on it. And, uh, I'm not really a, uh, sweeping sorta fella.\n",
      "Phoebe Oh, David, I, I think you are a sweeping sorta fella. I mean, you're a sweeper! ...trapped inside a physicist's body.\n",
      "David Rrrreally.\n",
      "Phoebe Oh, yeah, oh, I'm sure of it. You should just do it, just sweep and throw me.\n",
      "David ...Now? Now?\n",
      "Phoebe Oh yeah, right now.\n",
      "David Okay, okay, okay. (Gets ready to sweep, and then picks up a laptop computer) Y'know what, this was just really expensive. (Puts it down elsewhere. Then picks up a microscope) And I'll take- this was a gift. (Moves it)\n",
      "Phoebe Okay, now you're just kinda tidying.\n",
      "David Okay, what the hell, what the hell. (Sweeps the remaining papers off the desk and grabs Phoebe) You want me to actually throw you or you-you wanna just hop?\n",
      "Phoebe I can hop. (She hops onto the table)\n",
      "Ross So tell me something. What does the phrase 'no date pact' mean to you?\n",
      "Monica I'm sorry, okay. It's just that Chandler has somebody, and Phoebe has somebody- I thought I'd ask Fun Bobby.\n",
      "Chandler Fun Bobby? Your ex-boyfriend Fun Bobby?\n",
      "Monica Yeah.\n",
      "Joey You know more than one Fun Bobby?\n",
      "Chandler I happen to know a Fun Bob.\n",
      "Rachel (Brings Joey a mug of coffee) Okay, here we go...\n",
      "Joey Ooh ooh ooh ooh, there's no room for milk!\n",
      "Rachel (Glances at Joey and then sips his coffee) There. Now there is.\n",
      "Ross Okay, so on our no-date evening, three of you now have dates.\n",
      "Joey Uh, four.\n",
      "Ross Four.\n",
      "Rachel Five.\n",
      "Ross Five. (Buries his head in his hands)\n",
      "Rachel Sorry. Paolo's catching an earlier flight.\n",
      "Joey Yeah, and I met this really hot single mom at the store. What's an elf to do?\n",
      "Ross Okay, so I'm gonna be the only one standing there alone when the ball drops?\n",
      "Rachel Oh, c'mon. We'll have, we'll have a big party, and no-one'll know who's with who.\n",
      "Ross Hey, y'know, this is so not what I needed right now.\n",
      "Monica What's the matter?\n",
      "Ross Oh, it's-it's Marcel. He keeps shutting me out, y'know? He's walking around all the time dragging his hands...\n",
      "Chandler That's so weird, I had such a blast with him the other night.\n",
      "Ross Really.\n",
      "Chandler Yeah, we played, we watched TV.. that juggling thing is amazing.\n",
      "Ross What, uh... what juggling thing?\n",
      "Chandler With the balled-up socks? I figured you taught him that.\n",
      "Ross No.\n",
      "Chandler Y'know, it wasn't that big a deal. He just balled up socks... and a melon...\n",
      "Max Phoebe. Hi.\n",
      "Phoebe Oh, hi Max! Hey, do you know everybody?\n",
      "Max No. Have you seen David?\n",
      "Phoebe No, no, he hasn't been around.\n",
      "Max Well, if you see him, tell him to pack his bags. We are going to Minsk.\n",
      "Phoebe Minsk?\n",
      "Max Minsk. It's in Russia.\n",
      "Phoebe I know where Minsk is.\n",
      "Max We got the grant. Three years, all expenses paid.\n",
      "Phoebe So when, when do you leave?\n",
      "Max January first.\n",
      "Phoebe Hello?\n",
      "David Hey!\n",
      "Phoebe Hi.\n",
      "David Hi! (Kisses her) What-what're you doing here?\n",
      "Phoebe Um, well, Max told me about Minsk, so (Puts on a fake cheery voice) congratulations! This is so exciting!\n",
      "Max It'd be even more exciting if we were going.\n",
      "Phoebe Oh, you're not going? (Fake disappointed voice) Oh, why?\n",
      "Max Tell her, David. 'I don't wanna go to Minsk and work with Lifson and Yamaguchi and Flench, on nonononononono. I wanna stay here and make out with my girlfriend!!' (Storms out)\n",
      "David Thank you, Max. Thank you.\n",
      "Phoebe So-so you're really not going?\n",
      "David I don't know. I don't know what I'm gonna do. I just- you decide.\n",
      "Phoebe Oh don't do that.\n",
      "David Please.\n",
      "Phoebe Oh no no.\n",
      "David No, but I'm asking-\n",
      "Phoebe Oh, but I can't do that-\n",
      "David No, but I can't-\n",
      "Phoebe It's your thing, and-\n",
      "David -make the decision-\n",
      "Phoebe Okay, um, stay.\n",
      "David Stay.\n",
      "Phoebe Stay.\n",
      "Phoebe Getting so good at that! (She hops on)\n",
      "David It was Max's stuff. (They kiss)\n",
      "Janice I love this artichoke thing! Oh, don't tell me what's in it, the diet starts tomorrow! (Laughs her Janice laugh)\n",
      "Chandler You remember Janice.\n",
      "Monica Vividly.\n",
      "Monica Hi.\n",
      "Sandy Hi, I'm Sandy.\n",
      "Joey Sandy! Hi! C'mon in! (She enters, followed by a young boy and a younger girl)...You brought your kids.\n",
      "Sandy Yeah. That's okay, right?\n",
      "Ross Par-tay!\n",
      "Monica That thing is not coming in here.\n",
      "Ross 'That thing'? This is how you greet guests at a party? Let me ask you something, if I showed up here with my new girlfriend, she wouldn't be welcome in your home?\n",
      "Monica I'm guessing your new girlfriend wouldn't urinate on my coffee table.\n",
      "Ross Okay. He was more embarrassed about that than anyone. Okay? And for him to have the courage to walk back in here like nothing happened...\n",
      "Monica Alright. Just keep him away from me.\n",
      "Ross Thank you. (She walks off) C'mon, Marcel, whaddya say you and I do a little mingling? (Marcel runs off) Alright, I'll, uh... catch up with you later.\n",
      "Monica Oh my gosh! Rachel, honey.. are you okay? Where-where's Paolo?\n",
      "Rachel Rome. Jerk missed his flight.\n",
      "Phoebe And then... your face is bloated?\n",
      "Rachel No. Okay. I was at the airport, getting into a cab, when this woman- this blonde planet with a pocketbook- starts yelling at me. Something about how it was her cab first. And then the next thing I know she just starts- starts pulling me out by my hair! So I'm blowing my attack whistle thingy and three more cabs show up, and as I'm going to get into a cab she tackles me. And I hit my head on the kerb and cut my lip on my whistle...oh...everybody having fun at the party? (To Monica) Are people eating my dip?\n",
      "Sandy Y'know, when I saw you at the store last week, it was probably the first time I ever mentally undressed an elf.\n",
      "Joey Wow, that's, uh, dirty.\n",
      "Sandy Yeah.\n",
      "Joey Hey, kids...\n",
      "Ross (Watching Marcel play with Phoebe. To Chandler) Look at him. I'm not saying he has to spend the whole evening with me, but at least check in.\n",
      "Janice (Startles them) There you are! Haaah, you got away from me!\n",
      "Chandler (Imitating) But you found me!\n",
      "Janice Here, Ross, take our picture. (Hands him a camera and he starts snapping) Smile! You're on Janice Camera!\n",
      "Chandler Kill me. Kill me now.\n",
      "Monica Hey everybody! It's Fun Bobby!\n",
      "Fun Bobby Hey, sorry I'm late. But my, uh, grandfather, he- died about two hours ago. But I-I-I couldn't get a flight out 'til tomorrow, so here I am!\n",
      "Joey (Approaching) Hey Fun Bobby! Whoah! Who died?\n",
      "Fun Bobby It's gonna be an open casket, y'know, so at least I'll- I get to see him again.\n",
      "Janice (Ross is still taking their photo) Oh, I'm gonna blow this one up, and I'm gonna write 'Reunited' in glitter.\n",
      "Chandler Alright, Janice, that's it! Janice... Janice... Hey, Janice, when I invited you to this party I didn't necessarily think that it meant that we-\n",
      "Janice Oh, no. Oh, no.\n",
      "Chandler I'm sorry you misunderstood...\n",
      "Janice Oh my God. You listen to me, Chandler, you listen to me. One of these times is just gonna be your last chance with me. (She runs off)\n",
      "Chandler Oh, will you give me the thing. (Snatches the camera)\n",
      "Phoebe Hi, Max!\n",
      "Max Yoko. (To David) I've decided to go to Minsk without you.\n",
      "David Wow.\n",
      "Max It won't be the same- but it'll still be Minsk. Happy New Year.(Walks off)\n",
      "Phoebe Are you alright?\n",
      "David Yeah, I'm fine, I'm fine.\n",
      "Phoebe You're going to Minsk.\n",
      "David No, I'm... not going to Minsk.\n",
      "Phoebe Oh, you are so going to Minsk. You belong in Minsk. You can't stay here just 'cause of me.\n",
      "David Yes I can. Because if I go it means I have to break up with you, and I can't break up with you.\n",
      "Phoebe Oh yes, yes, yes you can. Just say, um, 'Phoebe, my work is my life and that's what I have to do right now'. And I say 'your work?! Your work?! How can you say that?!'. And then you say, um, 'it's tearing me apart, but I have no choice. Can't you understand that?'. And I say (Hits him) 'no! No! I can't understand that!'.\n",
      "David Uh, ow.\n",
      "Phoebe Ooh, sorry. Um, and, and then you put your arms around me. And then you put your arms around me. (He does so) And, um, and then you tell me that you love me and you'll never forget me.\n",
      "David I'll never forget you.\n",
      "Phoebe And then you say that it's almost midnight and you have to go because you don't wanna start the new year with me if you can't finish it. (They kiss) I'm gonna miss you. You scientist guy.\n",
      "Dick Clark (on TV) Hi, this is Dick Clark, live in Times Square. We're in a virtual snowstorm of confetti here in Times Square...\n",
      "Joey There y'go, kids.\n",
      "Chandler (To a woman who he has clearly just met) And then the peacock bit me. (Laughs) Please kiss me at midnight. (She leaves)\n",
      "Joey You seen Sandy?\n",
      "Chandler Ooh. Uh, I don't know how to tell you this, but she's in Monica's bedroom, getting it on with Max, that scientist geek. Ooh, look at that, I did know how to tell you.\n",
      "Rachel Vrrbddy, the bll is drrbing.\n",
      "All (in the kitchen) What?\n",
      "Rachel The bll is drrbing!\n",
      "Dick Clark (on TV) In twenty seconds it'll be midnight...\n",
      "Chandler And the moment of joy is upon us.\n",
      "Joey Looks like that no date pact thing worked out.\n",
      "Phoebe Everybody looks so happy. I hate that.\n",
      "Monica Not everybody's happy. Hey Bobby!\n",
      "Chandler Y'know, I uh.. just thought I'd throw this out here. I'm no math whiz, but I do believe there are three girls and three guys right here. (Makes kiss noise)\n",
      "Phoebe I dunno. I don't feel like kissing anyone tonight.\n",
      "Rachel I can't kiss anyone.\n",
      "Monica So I'm kissing everyone?\n",
      "Joey Nonono, you can't kiss Ross, that's your brother.\n",
      "Ross Perfect. Perfect. So now everybody's getting kissed but me.\n",
      "Chandler Alright, somebody kiss me. Somebody kiss me, it's midnight! Somebody kiss me!\n",
      "Joey Alrightalrightalright. (Kisses him. Ross takes a photo) There.\n",
      "Ross (Watching Marcel and talking to Rachel) I wanted this to work so much. I mean I'm still in there, changing his diapers, pickin' his fleas... but he's just phoning it in. Just so hard to accept the fact that something you love so much doesn't love you back.\n",
      "Rachel ...I think that bitch cracked my tooth.\n",
