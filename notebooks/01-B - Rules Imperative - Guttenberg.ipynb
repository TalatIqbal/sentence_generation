       " 'They were a family of the name of Martin , whom Emma well knew by character , as renting a large farm of Mr . Knightley , and residing in the parish of Donwell -- very creditably , she believed -- she knew Mr . Knightley thought highly of them -- but they must be coarse and unpolished , and very unfit to be the intimates of a girl who wanted only a little more knowledge and elegance to be quite perfect .',\n",

       " 'He loved to have the cloth laid , because it had been the fashion of his youth , but his conviction of suppers being very unwholesome made him rather sorry to see any thing put on it ; and while his hospitality would have welcomed his visitors to every thing , his care for their health made him grieve that they would eat .',\n",

       " 'Mrs . Goddard , and the teachers , and the girls and the affairs of the school in general , formed naturally a great part of the conversation -- and but for her acquaintance with the Martins of Abbey - Mill Farm , it must have been the whole .',\n",
       " 'Emma encouraged her talkativeness -- amused by such a picture of another set of beings , and enjoying the youthful simplicity which could speak with so much exultation of Mrs . Martin \\' s having \" _two_ parlours , two very good parlours , indeed ; one of them quite as large as Mrs . Goddard \\' s drawing - room ; and of her having an upper maid who had lived five - and - twenty years with her ; and of their having eight cows , two of them Alderneys , and one a little Welch cow , a very pretty little Welch cow indeed ; and of Mrs . Martin \\' s saying as she was so fond of it , it should be called _her_ cow ; and of their having a very handsome summer - house in their garden , where some day next year they were all to drink tea :-- a very handsome summer - house , large enough to hold a dozen people .\"',\n",
       " \"She had taken up a wrong idea , fancying it was a mother and daughter , a son and son ' s wife , who all lived together ; but when it appeared that the Mr . Martin , who bore a part in the narrative , and was always mentioned with approbation for his great good - nature in doing something or other , was a single man ; that there was no young Mrs . Martin , no wife in the case ; she did suspect danger to her poor little friend from all this hospitality and kindness , and that , if she were not taken care of , she might be required to sink herself forever .\",\n",
       " 'Mrs . Martin had told her one day ( and there was a blush as she said it ,) that it was impossible for any body to be a better son , and therefore she was sure , whenever he married , he would make a good husband .',\n",

       " 'Six years hence , if he could meet with a good sort of young woman in the same rank as his own , with a little money , it might be very desirable .\"',\n",
       " 'Dear Miss Woodhouse , he would be thirty years old !\"',\n",
       " 'Whatever money he might come into when his father died , whatever his share of the family property , it is , I dare say , all afloat , all employed in his stock , and so forth ; and though , with diligence and good luck , he may be rich in time , it is next to impossible that he should have realised any thing yet .\"',\n",
       " '\" I wish you may not get into a scrape , Harriet , whenever he does marry ;-- I mean , as to being acquainted with his wife -- for though his sisters , from a superior education , are not to be altogether objected to , it does not follow that he might marry any body at all fit for you to notice .',\n",
       " 'There can be no doubt of your being a gentleman \\' s daughter , and you must support your claim to that station by every thing within your own power , or there will be plenty of people who would take pleasure in degrading you .\"',\n",
       " 'I want to see you permanently well connected , and to that end it will be advisable to have as few odd acquaintance as may be ; and , therefore , I say that if you should still be in this country when Mr . Martin marries , I wish you may not be drawn in by your intimacy with the sisters , to be acquainted with the wife , who will probably be some mere farmer \\' s daughter , without education .\"',\n",
       " \"His appearance was very neat , and he looked like a sensible young man , but his person had no other advantage ; and when he came to be contrasted with gentlemen , she thought he must lose all the ground he had gained in Harriet ' s inclination .\",\n",
       " '\" I think , Harriet , since your acquaintance with us , you have been repeatedly in the company of some such very real gentlemen , that you must yourself be struck with the difference in Mr . Martin .',\n",
       " 'I am sure you must have been struck by his awkward look and abrupt manner , and the uncouthness of a voice which I heard to be wholly unmodulated as I stood here .\"',\n",
       " 'You might not see one in a hundred with _gentleman_ so plainly written as in Mr . Knightley .',\n",
       " 'You must see the difference .\"',\n",
       " 'He will be a completely gross , vulgar farmer , totally inattentive to appearances , and thinking of nothing but profit and loss .\"',\n",
       " 'He was a great deal too full of the market to think of any thing else -- which is just as it should be , for a thriving man .',\n",
       " 'They might be more safely held up as a pattern .',\n",
       " \"Neither would Mr . Knightley ' s downright , decided , commanding sort of manner , though it suits _him_ very well ; his figure , and look , and situation in life seem to allow it ; but if any young man were to set about copying him , he would not be sufferable .\",\n",
       " 'If he means any thing , it must be to please you .',\n",
       " 'She thought it would be an excellent match ; and only too palpably desirable , natural , and probable , for her to have much merit in planning it .',\n",
       " \"She had already satisfied herself that he thought Harriet a beautiful girl , which she trusted , with such frequent meetings at Hartfield , was foundation enough on his side ; and on Harriet ' s there could be little doubt that the idea of being preferred by him would have all the usual weight and efficacy .\",\n",
       " 'And he was really a very pleasing young man , a young man whom any woman not fastidious might like .',\n",
       " \"He was reckoned very handsome ; his person much admired in general , though not by her , there being a want of elegance of feature which she could not dispense with :-- but the girl who could be gratified by a Robert Martin ' s riding about the country to get walnuts for her might very well be conquered by Mr . Elton ' s admiration .\",\n",
       " '\" I think they will neither of them do the other any good .\"',\n",

       " 'They will read together .',\n",
       " 'The list she drew up when only fourteen -- I remember thinking it did her judgment so much credit , that I preserved it some time ; and I dare say she may have made out a very good list now .',\n",

       " '\" I should have been sorry , Mr . Knightley , to be dependent on _your_ recommendation , had I quitted Mr . Woodhouse \\' s family and wanted another situation ; I do not think you would have spoken a good word for me to any body .',\n",
       " 'You might not give Emma such a complete education as your powers would seem to promise ; but you were receiving a very good education from _her_ , on the very material matrimonial point of submitting your own will , and doing as you were bid ; and if Weston had asked me to recommend him a wife , I should certainly have named Miss Taylor .\"',\n",
       " 'She will grow just refined enough to be uncomfortable with those among whom birth and circumstances have placed her home .',\n",

Knightley , if I take the liberty ( I consider myself , you know , as having somewhat of the privilege of speech that Emma \\' s mother might have had ) the liberty of hinting that I do not think any possible good can arise from Harriet Smith \\' s intimacy being made a matter of much discussion among you .',\n",
       " 'Pray excuse me ; but supposing any little inconvenience may be apprehended from the intimacy , it cannot be expected that Emma , accountable to nobody but her father , who perfectly approves the acquaintance , should put an end to it , so long as it is a source of pleasure to herself .',\n",
